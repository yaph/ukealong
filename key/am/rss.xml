        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/onerepublic-rescue-me-2/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  Lowered a whole step from the original key, because some people are really going to struggle with the Bm from the original key (that version is also available).  Side note: keep practicing and you'll master it!

Chords Used:  Am, G, C, F

As performed by OneRepublic.  This was a request from my own two boys, age 7 & 10.  If you read these comments, they would be thrilled if you watched some of their videos and followed them.

Older son: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnXyBzSlqfs_N0Sz8EeTj7Q
Younger son: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLCD1tFgLd6rgT1WzdR4paA

And if you are reading all of this, please follow my other ukulele channel: https://www.youtube.com/ukestuff  As these videos cannot be monetized, subscriptions and views on the other channel really will help me out.

Tutorial Video (GCEA & DGBE): https://youtu.be/JZA5jnT4brY
