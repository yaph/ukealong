        <title><![CDATA[Melanie Martinez - Dear Porcupines - Key of Dm]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/melanie-martinez-dear-porcupines/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Dm.  Raised a whole step from the original.

Chords Used: Dm, F, Bb, A7

As performed by Melanie Martinez.

CONTENT WARNING: Don't use this in a school setting.  The song is all about bullying and how success makes the "porcupines" decide to be your friend...and the lyrics say the rest.

This was a request from Książkoholiczka...3 months ago.  I am not planning on making a Baritone, Lyric, or Tutorial for this video, but if the views are substantial, I may consider adding those videos later.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.
