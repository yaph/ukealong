        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/anne-janelle-angels-we-have-heard-on-high/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  A new melody to the traditional Christmas Carol (and a new verse).
Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of B-flat.  Think it is an unfriendly key?  I also transposed the song to C, making it far easier to play (https://youtu.be/gxAvBJza7iM).

As performed by Anne Janelle with James Hill.  Anne Janelle is a singer and cello player, and is married to ukulele virtuoso and ukulele educator James Hill.  Anne released this song this week--and released a handwritten chart of the chords of the song today, inviting people to play along.  As it is Christmas Day, this will be the last Christmas/holiday play along that I create in 2018.

If you are new to the channel and/or ukulele, you can find all kinds of play along videos like these, which allow you to play along with the music you already know and love--sometimes modified to be in more ukulele friendly keys.  There are also a number of great ukulele instructors on YouTube, including Cynthia Lin, Kate DeNure (One Music School), John Atkins (The Ukulele Teacher), Mike Lynch (who passed away in January of 2018, but his many videos are still out there to learn from), Stu Fuchs, Aldrine Guerrero (Ukulele Underground) and more.

Uses a version of the song without (or with reduced) voices to encourage your own singing while still having a “backing track” available?  Want a version with the voices?. Look for a similar song with “Ukulele Play Along.”
