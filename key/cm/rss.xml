        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/taron-egerton-i-m-still-standing/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Cm and C.  Raised a whole step from the original (Bbm and Bb).  This is an updated video, just for the intro slide and the description.  Sadly, you cannot update a video with a new version on YouTube.  I left a link to this video on the original video.

As performed by Taron Egerton in “Sing.”  I had originally had Taron Egerton's name wrong, and a number of people wrote comments to complain about it.

My boys enjoyed Sing and frequently sing this song.  I had started working on but moved on to other videos.  Katie Denure (One Music School) posted a tutorial today (https://youtu.be/m_Xoe9g00oc), which inspired me to wrap up this video.  I took away some of the fast Ab Bb C changes that occur at the end of some phrases...feel free to add them back in your own practice.  This video offers some good Barre chord practice (partial and full) with Cm, Ab, and Bb.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Cm.

As performed by Tumble Tots.

Tonight as we were driving back from seeing Incredibles 2, my six year old (fresh out of kindergarten) asked, “Can we sing ‘Elephants Have Wrinkles?’”  So...I did as most fathers would do...I opened Apple Music and we listened to it...five times.  Then my son asked if I would make a play along of this song...so I did.

        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/game-of-thrones-theme-ukulele-play-along/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of Cm and C.

Published a couple of days before the beginning of Season 7 of Game of Thrones.  This show is not for kids, but the theme song is fantastic and they have probably heard it.  Follow the chords (the Ab is tricky as a barre chord, but it comes pretty naturally after a Cm), and there is an optional picking part for the last 4 measure.
