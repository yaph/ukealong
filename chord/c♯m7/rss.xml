Driving Home For Christmas - Chris Rea

Using the chords: A  Bm  C#m7  D  E7  Em  F#m  G
I have simplified the chords to make the song accessible to more players. If you would prefer, you can replae the E7 chord tih an E and the C#m7 chord with a C#m.

Suggested Strum Patterns: D DU U DU

        <description><![CDATA[This tutorial will show you how to play Done For Me by Charlie Puth featuring Kehlani on the ukulele. The chords used are Bm7 Abdim7 Gmaj7 C#m7 F#7.

*The Abdim7 should be G#dim7 but I couldn't find the diagram in the chord font I use. Had to use the enharmonic.
