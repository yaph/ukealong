Our local ukulele group is working on this song, and I was asked to check out the chords they are using (and the tablature they are using), and I made a play along video (there is no tablature in this song).

        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Key of G: A7, Hawaiian D7, G, Cm, E7, G7, D, D+.  The D+ is an uncommon chord..make sure to practice it before starting the song!

The original recording is in A (a version in this key was created, too).  the pitch has been lowered to G...and no, Elvis did not have a cold while singing it.

The original YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2h0f1VgDrM

The ukulele font comes from Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com]]></description>
