        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  Originally in A, lowered one whole step.

As performed by Naill Horan.

I really wanted to bring this song to you in the original key, but there was a need to switch from F#m to E...which just isn’t GCEA ukulele friendly.  Therefore, I modified this for the key of G.  Try playing this by alternatively plucking the 3rd string (C string) and the 2nd and 1st strings (E and A strings) at the same time.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
