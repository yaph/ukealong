House Of Gold - Twenty One Pilots

Using the chords: C  F  G  A7  Am  Dm  Bbm
** A good chance to practice the B flat minor chord! **

Suggested Strum Patterns: D DU U DU or D DU DU DU - it is fast

Notes:
Tyler Joseph plays a C chord for the first section (chorus). I have used the chords as a guide to help singing but you can play a C chord if you prefer.

        <title><![CDATA[Burn The Ballroom - Crazy]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/burn-the-ballroom-crazy/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational purposes--all rights remain with the group.

"Crazy" by Burn the Ballroom.  In the Key of F (F, A, Dm, Bb, Bbm, C, C7).  I heard this song as bumper music on the Tony Kornheiser Show--and it stick in my head as a great song for a ukulele play along.  The lyrics may not be appropriate for young students.  The melody is wonderful!

This song was fun to work out, as the chords were not readily available on various "tab" websites.

The group's albums and this song can be found on iTunes and Amazon.   You can also access the group's YouTube recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrSlr2LxdDk
