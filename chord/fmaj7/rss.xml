        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/vince-guaraldi-trio-christmas-time-is-here/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  But it is a jazz song, so who really knows.

As performed by The Vince Guaraldi Trio

Okay...NOT the easiest song, and certainly not something you will use with beginners...however, this is a roadmap in the original Key that is playable with practice...and really, who doesn't want this in their repertoire?

Need to take it slower?  Use the gear icon on the video to slow the speed!

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.

As performed by Alessia Cara

The audio has been adjusted to move from the original Key of E to F, and then to remove the key change at the end.  Note the barre chords: Bbm, Bb, F, and Fmaj7 (These last two occur at the end)
