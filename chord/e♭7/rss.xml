Our local ukulele group is working on this song, and I was asked to check out the chords they are using (and the tablature they are using), and I made a play along video (there is no tablature in this song).

As performed on Schoolhouse Rock.

This past week, the creator of Schoolhouse Rock (Bob Dorough) passed away.  I remember seeing these cartoons throughout my childhood (I was born in the 70s), and while they weren’t my favorite, we didn’t have YouTube or Cable, and you just watched them anyway.  Of all the Schoolhouse Rock cartoons, this was probably my favorite.  So, consider this a tribute to the work of Bob Dorough, as well as growing up in the 1970s.
