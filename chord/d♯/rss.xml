        <title><![CDATA[Gilligan’s Island Ukulele Play Along (TV Show Video background)]]></title>

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.

Here’s a lesson on barre chords, using the theme to Gilligan’s Island.  A lot of people may not know this show, but as I grew up, this show was one of the shows in syndication—and I watched it every afternoon.  Here’s a great way to learn some barre chords (only two shapes, the “Am” and the “A” shapes).  The second half of the song (ending credits) moves quite a bit faster.  Don’t forget that you can use YouTube’s tools to slow down a video and retain the pitch.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

        <title><![CDATA[La La Land Cast - Another Day Of Sun]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/la-la-land-cast-another-day-of-sun/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  In the Key of G and G#.  There are fifteen chords in all.  These are listed on the second screen of the video.

The original song is in Ab and A...and it becomes much easier to play in F.  However, the original audio becomes strange if the pitch is modified that much.  Therefore, I dropped the audio a half step to G...resulting in this play along.

The last section modulates a half step...this is pretty easy to do with the barre chords provided.  That said...you need to be ready for them.

This is not a ukulele play along for beginners...but it is a great song, and advanced players should have some play along videos that challenge them, too!

The original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV5XmoWC8Mo

The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education available from ukefarm.com.  I did have to manually create some of the second position barre chords for the video (the text and chords were prepared in Keynote)]]></description>
