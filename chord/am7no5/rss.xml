As performed by Christina Perri

I'll be honest..this was a fun one to work on.  It is shifted up a whole step from the original recording.   None of the online lead sheets matched what I was hearing..and I tried to incorporate some of the passing tones with chords like Cmaj7.  In this key, the song is pretty straightforward and fun to play.  Listen to the song for strumming pattern ideas (e.g. single strums at the beginning).

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  But it is a jazz song, so who really knows.

As performed by The Vince Guaraldi Trio

Okay...NOT the easiest song, and certainly not something you will use with beginners...however, this is a roadmap in the original Key that is playable with practice...and really, who doesn't want this in their repertoire?

Need to take it slower?  Use the gear icon on the video to slow the speed!
