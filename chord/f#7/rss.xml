        <description><![CDATA[This tutorial will show you how to play Done For Me by Charlie Puth featuring Kehlani on the ukulele. The chords used are Bm7 Abdim7 Gmaj7 C#m7 F#7.

*The Abdim7 should be G#dim7 but I couldn't find the diagram in the chord font I use. Had to use the enharmonic.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of D and F...18 chords in all!  I was originally considering changing the key...but the original key is about as ukulele friendly as you are going to find, even with some expanded chords.  I think these chords work better than most of the written chord charts you will find for this song on the Internet.  Enjoy!

As performed in Aladdin!

        <title><![CDATA[La La Land Cast - Another Day Of Sun]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/la-la-land-cast-another-day-of-sun/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  In the Key of G and G#.  There are fifteen chords in all.  These are listed on the second screen of the video.

The original song is in Ab and A...and it becomes much easier to play in F.  However, the original audio becomes strange if the pitch is modified that much.  Therefore, I dropped the audio a half step to G...resulting in this play along.

The last section modulates a half step...this is pretty easy to do with the barre chords provided.  That said...you need to be ready for them.

This is not a ukulele play along for beginners...but it is a great song, and advanced players should have some play along videos that challenge them, too!

The original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV5XmoWC8Mo

The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education available from ukefarm.com.  I did have to manually create some of the second position barre chords for the video (the text and chords were prepared in Keynote)]]></description>
