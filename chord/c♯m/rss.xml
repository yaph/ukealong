        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/drop-baby-drop-ukulele-play-along/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of A.

As performed by the Mana’o Company.  This song was released in 1991 and became popular at jam sessions in Hawaii.  It is also a great song to learn/practice the moveable Am chord shape.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
