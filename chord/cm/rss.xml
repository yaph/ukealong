        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Cm.

As performed by Tumble Tots.

Tonight as we were driving back from seeing Incredibles 2, my six year old (fresh out of kindergarten) asked, “Can we sing ‘Elephants Have Wrinkles?’”  So...I did as most fathers would do...I opened Apple Music and we listened to it...five times.  Then my son asked if I would make a play along of this song...so I did.
