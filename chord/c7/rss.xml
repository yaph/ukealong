        <description><![CDATA[**NOT FOR BEGINNERS**

I'll See You In My Dreams by Joe Brown And The Bruvvers.  For educational use.  Chords Used: A7, Am, Bb, Bb6, Bb6-2, Bbm6, Bbmaj7, C, C7, Cm6, Cmaj7, D, D7, D7-2, D7(HI), D9, Dm, E7, E7-2, Edim, Em7, F, F/C, F6, F6-5, F7, Fmaj7, G7 (yes, this song uses 28 chords).  The video is from YouTuber Elisa M. and may be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWERLNXIZGc.  The chord progressions I used were heavily inspired by Jim’s Ukulele Songbook, which may be found at https://ozbcoz.com/Songs/downloadpdf.php?ID=3748%2Csongbook&fbclid=IwAR2UAs9814iikntmCk_pnDdsa9bE964sFKWluY5DTEEr4dIH5qDr2sdSB50 .
