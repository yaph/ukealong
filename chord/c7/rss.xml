Chords Used: F, C, Dm Bb, A, Gm, Cm, D, C7

Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton.  This version does not have the bridge.  It’s been lowered by 4 semitones to the key of C so beginner ukulele students can play along.  Some of the more complex chords have been simplified or skipped.

        <link><![CDATA[http://ukealong.com/song/war-why-can't-we-be-friends/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  Raised a whole step from the original.

As performed by War.

Rock Cowles of The Spartanburg Ukulele Club posted a song sheet of this song on March 23, 2019, and I thought it would make a great play along.  I do use some different chords than the Spartanburg chord sheet.  I have created six versions of this play along...full versions for CGEA, DGBE, and Lyrics only (chords above), as well as a modified version that will be better for schools.  The full version is blocked in some countries, the modified version is not.  A YouTube search should bring up all versions of the song, or you could visit ukestuff.info and access the full listing of songs with clickable links (updated monthly).
