        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/shadows-lullaby-ukulele-play-along-in-f/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  In the original key.

Chords Used: C, C7, F, F (add 9), Bb, Gm, G

From Jim Henson's Bear in the Big Blue House.

This was a request from the comments on the YouTube channel by Christopher Martin.  I made a version in two keys as the original key of F is difficult for some players.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.

        <description><![CDATA[Title theme from the series True Detective. Performed & written by The Handsome Family.

Note: The Fadd9 could also be played as a regular F but the former sounds somewhat rougher which somehow fits the mood of this haunting but beautiful tune.]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[Ingrid Michaelson - You And I - Key of C]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/ingrid-michaelson-you-and-i/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C (original key).

As performed by Ingrid Michaelson.

Check the lyrics as this may not be appropriate for use in a school setting (i.e. “do what the bunnies do,” and “spoon.”).

This version Includes some of the color chords (Fadd9) that Ingrid uses but are not on the chord charts you will find on the internet.  For the Gsus4, play a G chord and add the pinky at the same time.

The original leads to a final chorus that is not accompanied by ukulele.  I ended the play along at that point.  Sorry about the chords there..Ingrid switches to Csus4 to C to Csus4 to C at the end and I didn’t want to add yet another slide.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
