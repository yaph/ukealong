        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of D and F...18 chords in all!  I was originally considering changing the key...but the original key is about as ukulele friendly as you are going to find, even with some expanded chords.  I think these chords work better than most of the written chord charts you will find for this song on the Internet.  Enjoy!

As performed in Aladdin!

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  Transposed up a whole step from the original in Eb.

As performed by Christina Perri.

What an absolutely gorgeous song.  The bridge is stunning, and the ending going from dim7 to tonic is outstanding.  And it works well with the ukulele.  I may try placing this in G, which would be even easier to play on the ukulele—not sure how it will sound in that key (transposed up two whole steps).  The tricky chords are the Bb and the Bbm, and as things go, those aren’t too bad.
