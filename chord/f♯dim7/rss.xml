        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of C, F, and G

The songs in the medley:

When Irish Eyes Are Smiling (In C)
The Black Velvet Band (Modulates to F)
The Boys from County Amargh (Modulates to G)

As performed by Foster & Allen

I wanted to make a play along for “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,” and this version was straightforward—but has two other traditional Irish songs.  And thus a medley play along.  I considered shortening the song—but the keys are straightforward and the hardest chord is a diminished chord.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Bobby Darin.

In the original key.  The only “difficult” chord is F#dim...but this is also a great song to use to learn that chord.

As I upload this, it is my dad’s birthday, so Happy Birthday to him.  Sorry there haven’t been many videos lately...I have been working on content for school (I may upload it) and one Play Along was blocked (Fields of Gold...A shame!).

        <title><![CDATA[Gene Autry - Here Comes Santa Claus]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/gene-autry-here-comes-santa-claus/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Best with GCEA tuned ukuleles (due to embedded chord charts). Key of C.  The second part of the melody has a fast chord progression...it is suggested that you practice it separately.

The original version was in C# (!), so the audio has been lowered a half step.  The full version has a quick modulation to G, and a couple of verses that refer to Christianity.  For the sake of public schools, these have been removed in a shortened version (link: https://youtu.be/V0rESDdlBIw)

Created on an iPad with Luma Fusion, iCab Mobile. Twisted Wave, and Any Font.  The ukulele chord font is a part of Chordette for Education which can be found at ukefarm.com]]></description>
