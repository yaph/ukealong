I'm trying a different approach with these videos, using images from another app rather than recreating a chord chart.  What do you think (leave a comment!)?

        <description><![CDATA[This tutorial will show you how to play Done For Me by Charlie Puth featuring Kehlani on the ukulele. The chords used are Bm7 Abdim7 Gmaj7 C#m7 F#7.

*The Abdim7 should be G#dim7 but I couldn't find the diagram in the chord font I use. Had to use the enharmonic.
