        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/side-by-side-ukulele-play-along/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of D (Originally in D#, so lowered a half step).

As performed by Nick Lucas.

One my initial goals with the Play Along Videos was to bridge the music that is typically played at ukulele jam sessions so that younger players who might not know the songs could experience some of the epertoire before attending a jam session.  I attended a jam session on 3/30/18, and this was one of the songs and is one of the songs that is played every time I go to a jam session.  If you haven’t heard it, play through it.  The song was originally written in 1921 and has been covered a lot, even by the Beatles.  This version is from 1944.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of D and F...18 chords in all!  I was originally considering changing the key...but the original key is about as ukulele friendly as you are going to find, even with some expanded chords.  I think these chords work better than most of the written chord charts you will find for this song on the Internet.  Enjoy!

As performed in Aladdin!
