As performed on Schoolhouse Rock.

This past week, the creator of Schoolhouse Rock (Bob Dorough) passed away.  I remember seeing these cartoons throughout my childhood (I was born in the 70s), and while they weren’t my favorite, we didn’t have YouTube or Cable, and you just watched them anyway.  Of all the Schoolhouse Rock cartoons, this was probably my favorite.  So, consider this a tribute to the work of Bob Dorough, as well as growing up in the 1970s.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
