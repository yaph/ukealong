        <description><![CDATA[Ukulele simplified chords for Shotgun. Instead of using a Bflat I replaced it with Gm7. I also used 4th fingr for the C chord to open your hand and leave the other three finger ready for the 1st three chords.
The backing track belongs to ProSingKaraoke - George Ezra - Shotgun (Karaoke Version With Lyrics)
