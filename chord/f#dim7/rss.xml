Chords Shown: C, C7, F, Fm6, G7, A7, D7, F#dim7, B7, E7, Fm

As performed by Christopher Davis-Shannon.  Special thanks to him, as he gave me permission to use this song and also provided help with the chords shown.  Incidentally, he plays the song "in C" but on a ukulele tuned up a minor third (i.e. Eb).

Tutorial Video (GCEA & DGBE):

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.

        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/foster-&-allen-when-irish-eyes-are-smiling-black-velvet-band-the-boys-from-the/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of C, F, and G

The songs in the medley:

When Irish Eyes Are Smiling (In C)
The Black Velvet Band (Modulates to F)
The Boys from County Amargh (Modulates to G)

As performed by Foster & Allen

I wanted to make a play along for “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,” and this version was straightforward—but has two other traditional Irish songs.  And thus a medley play along.  I considered shortening the song—but the keys are straightforward and the hardest chord is a diminished chord.

        <title><![CDATA[Gene Autry - Here Comes Santa Claus ]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/gene-autry-here-comes-santa-claus/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Best with GCEA tuned ukuleles (due to embedded chord charts). Key of C.  The second part of the melody has a fast chord progression...it is suggested that you practice it separately.

The original version was in C# (!), so the audio has been lowered a half step.  The full version has a quick modulation to G, and a couple of verses that refer to Christianity.  For the sake of public schools, these have been removed in this version.  If you want to play the modulation and sing all the verses, please use the full version (link: https://youtu.be/3rbEFcHRrbM)

Created on an iPad with Luma Fusion, iCab Mobile. Twisted Wave, and Any Font.  The ukulele chord font is a part of Chordette for Education which can be found at ukefarm.com]]></description>
