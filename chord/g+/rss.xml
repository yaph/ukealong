Chords Used: C, Fadd2, G, Am, F, G+, D

So You Had A Bad Day by Daniel Powter.  It’s been lowered by 3 semitones so beginner ukulele students can play along.  Also, the bridge has been removed to help simplify it.  While I created this for ukulele, any instrument that plays chords would use it (guitar, keyboard, etc.).

        <title><![CDATA[Blackbird - The Beatles - Uke Play-Along - Key of G]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/blackbird-the-beatles-uke-play-along/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[Not for the faint of heart. This is a tough one.  Lots of interesting chords, which is unusual for my channel because I try to stay to about 6 basic chords.  Chords are G, Am7, D, C, A7, D#dim, Em, G-aug, A9, Cm, D7, Gm7, Dm, F.  Is that enough for ya?  ;)

When there are single chords in a row...I'd suggest beginning by just doing one down strum for each chord (that will help you switch).  When there is more than chord in a row, you might try a D- DU kind of shuffling strum.  Once you've got the chords going, just listen to the recording and the strumming that feels good.

People requested a version of Blackbird that was slower to help them get up to speed for the original version.  I created a version at 70% speed, 80% speed, and 90% speed.

Find the version of Blackbird at 70% tempo at https://youtu.be/KquusSdT6OE

Find the version of Blackbird at 80% tempo at https://youtu.be/EmEa-4NhP5I
