Chords Used: C, Fadd2, G, Am, F, G+, D

So You Had A Bad Day by Daniel Powter.  It’s been lowered by 3 semitones so beginner ukulele students can play along.  Also, the bridge has been removed to help simplify it.  While I created this for ukulele, any instrument that plays chords would use it (guitar, keyboard, etc.).
