        <title><![CDATA[Taron Egerton - I'm Still Standing]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/taron-egerton-i-m-still-standing/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Cm and C.  Raised a whole step from the original (Bbm and Bb).  This is an updated video, just for the intro slide and the description.  Sadly, you cannot update a video with a new version on YouTube.  I left a link to this video on the original video.

As performed by Taron Egerton in “Sing.”  I had originally had Taron Egerton's name wrong, and a number of people wrote comments to complain about it.

My boys enjoyed Sing and frequently sing this song.  I had started working on but moved on to other videos.  Katie Denure (One Music School) posted a tutorial today (https://youtu.be/m_Xoe9g00oc), which inspired me to wrap up this video.  I took away some of the fast Ab Bb C changes that occur at the end of some phrases...feel free to add them back in your own practice.  This video offers some good Barre chord practice (partial and full) with Cm, Ab, and Bb.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
