        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Chords Used: G D Em C B7 Am F

Spirit (from Disney’s The Lion King) by Beyoncé.  It’s been raised by 2 semitones and the modulation has been removed so beginner ukulele students can play along.  Also, the “quick change” chords have not been included.  As for the B7 chord, feel free to do it 432X instead of using the barre.
