        <title><![CDATA[Perfect Pitch Ukulele Play Along (Updated)]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/perfect-pitch-ukulele-play-along-updated/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.   Chords optimized for CGEA ukulele.   Key of F (C7, F, Am, Dm, Bb, C, Cm7, G7, Bbm7, C#7).  The Bacon Brothers dropped this video on Social Media while on tour.  As of yet, there are no chord arrangements of it yet...but as I celebrate my 30th ukulele play along video this month (30 videos in 30 days...or 22 days), I thought I would do something special.  It is a great song, and there is a wonderful reference to "Ukulele Lady" in the instrumental break.  I included their actual video in the play along...hopefully it isn't too distracting from the chords.  A link to that video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5vWSIe2GCE

Updated for some spelling errors from the original video; remade on Luma Fusion for iOS.

The material, of course, remains the property of the Bacon Brothers...hopefully they are okay with the play along idea.  In the video, some other versions of some of the chords are used (such as C being played with a barre chord), but I tried to use standard root position chords as much as possible.
