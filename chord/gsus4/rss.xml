        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

Chords Used: C, Gsus4, G7, F, D7, Ab, C7

As performed by The Ka'au Crater Boys.

This song has become a part of the traditional ukulele repertoire as a solo (you can find versions on the web if you would like to learn it), but in this case, you will be acting as the "rhythm section" underneath the solo.

I did not create a tutorial for this video, and you can play any strumming pattern that goes along with the rhythm section.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.

        <title><![CDATA[Riptide Ukulele Play Along (Large Noises Recording)]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/riptide-ukulele-play-along-large-noises-recording/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.

As performed by Vance Joy in the video by Large Noises (https://youtu.be/ES_aFUIvBz0).

I have a couple of other videos of this song, and other ukulele play alongs exist as well.  I came across this version tonight, and I think it is my favorite that I have seen in context of trying to play along.  It is Vance in a performance setting (unlike the other video I made where he is on a trolley) with steady volume throughout as well as more consistent tempos than the “official” recording.

Vance plays a baritone ukulele, by the way.

Strumming patterns:

Verses: DD UDU
Chorus: DUX U UXU (X=chuck or chunk)
Bridge: Syncopated rhythm without any repetition.  Lots of heavy strumming!

Finger picking guide appears in the video (H=hammer on)

Can’t play the patterns?  Just have fun and play along.  You can also play DD UDU throughout the whole song if you like.

        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/the-rainbow-connection-ukulele-play-along/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  The original is in A and modulates to Bb.  I shifted the song to G (down a whole step) and then kept the song in G.

As performed in The Muppet Movie.

This is one of my favorite songs, going back to my childhood.  Most of the arrangements I see of this song are harder than they have to be...with this version, the hardest chords are Gsus4 (not that hard) and Bm (a barre chord, but a basic one).  I hope you enjoy this one as much as I enjoyed making it.

        <title><![CDATA[Ingrid Michaelson - You And I]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/ingrid-michaelson-you-and-i/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C (original key).

As performed by Ingrid Michaelson.

Check the lyrics as this may not be appropriate for use in a school setting (i.e. “do what the bunnies do,” and “spoon.”).

This version Includes some of the color chords (Fadd9) that Ingrid uses but are not on the chord charts you will find on the internet.  For the Gsus4, play a G chord and add the pinky at the same time.

The original leads to a final chorus that is not accompanied by ukulele.  I ended the play along at that point.  Sorry about the chords there..Ingrid switches to Csus4 to C to Csus4 to C at the end and I didn’t want to add yet another slide.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA Ukulele.  Keys of F & G.

As performed by Muffin Songs in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs9cCeTsT8Q

I was preparing simpler versions of this song and heard this version and wanted to add the chords to it.  This song, with a key change and some easier added chords really makes this song fun to play.
