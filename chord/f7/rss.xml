        <description><![CDATA[**NOT FOR BEGINNERS**

        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/christopher-davis-shannon-don-t-call-me-honey-baritone-ukulele/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.   For DGBE Ukulele.  Key of F, a whole step higher than the original version.  There just wasn't a good key for Baritone ukulele (G would have made Davis-Shannon sound like Mickey Mouse).

Chords Used: F, F7, Bb, Bbm6, C7, D7, G7, Bdim7, E7, A7, Bm

As performed by Christopher Davis-Shannon.  Special thanks to him, as he gave me permission to use this song and also provided help with the chords shown .  Incidentally, he plays the song "in C" but on a ukulele tuned up a minor third (i.e. Eb).

Tutorial Video (GCEA & DGBE):

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.
