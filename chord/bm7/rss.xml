Chords Used: G, Bm, Em, C, D, D7, F#7, Bm7, Am

Tutorial Video: https://youtu.be/iEUOmDsUp70

Original performance by me, because the Twenty One Pilots version in C is too high (or too low) for my voice).  I don't make many videos of my own playing/singing for the video play alongs.  It isn't a perfect performance...and that's okay!
