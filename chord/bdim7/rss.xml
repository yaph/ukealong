[Corrected Version from the Original Upload]

Our local ukulele group is working on this song, and I was asked to check out the chords they are using (and the tablature they are using), and I made a play along video (there is no tablature in this song).

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C

As performed by Fats Domino.  I have wanted to do this since hearing about his death on October 24, 2017 (Today is 11/03/2017).  Some of the chords are ambiguous, but the chords as presented work OK.

        <title><![CDATA[Ukulele Lady Ukulele Play Along (Muppets Version)]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/ukulele-lady-ukulele-play-along-muppets-version/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Key of F: Key of F: F, C7, Bdim7, Dm, Am, G7, Bb, Cm7.

From the Muppets.  Originally in E (not a great key for ukulele).  Transposed to make it playable!  Original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFOvN5FEhsw

There are also famous recordings by Bette Midler.

This one was a bit tricky to figure out...all the versions of Ukulele Lady seem to do their own thing...be ready for the Bdim7 and Cm7 chords.
