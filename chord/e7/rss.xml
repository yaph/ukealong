        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  Raised a whole step from the original.

As performed by War.

Rock Cowles of The Spartanburg Ukulele Club posted a song sheet of this song on March 23, 2019, and I thought it would make a great play along.  I do use some different chords than the Spartanburg chord sheet.  I have created six versions of this play along...full versions for CGEA, DGBE, and Lyrics only (chords above), as well as a modified version that will be better for schools.  The full version is blocked in some countries, the modified version is not.  A YouTube search should bring up all versions of the song, or you could visit ukestuff.info and access the full listing of songs with clickable links (updated monthly).

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Moving background from downloops.com.

There is a master list of all similar play along videos at my blog: ukestuff.info.  Access to the blog, and all materials on the blog is free.
