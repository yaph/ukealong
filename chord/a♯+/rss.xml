        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  All My Loving by the Beatles.  Key of D: Em, A7, D, Bm, G, C, A#+.

The original performances of this song seem to be in E or E-flat, both which are not great keys for ukulele.   The final video comes from this YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMYfVuneBPU

I lowered the key to D; the Key of C is a better key for ukulele players with this song--but the audio starts sounding strange when you change pitch more than a whole step.  Therefore, I apologize for the A#+ chord.
