        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/israel-kamakawiwo-ole-what-a-wonderful-world/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[Performed by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole.
Written by Harold Arlen & E.Y. Harburg / George David Weiss & Bob Thiele & Israel Kamakawiwo'ole

The ukulele song for me and I guess for countless others. It got me into uke playing so I wanted to make a easy-to-follow version for other Iz fans out there.

The picture is of young Iz. I don't have the info of the photographer but I hope they will not mind me using it here. Iz has gone behind the rainbow long ago but I can't help wondering if he, as a kid or even later on in his life, ever dreamed of becoming the much loved artist he grew up to be.

I wanted to make a version where you can follow either chord markings in the text of the regular ones at the bottom of the video (or both).

For strumming help, see this helpful video from the wonderful Cynthia Lin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqDiaZ-pqyA

Note: The rather complicated Dm7 can be played as a regular Dm as well.]]></description>

        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/meghan-trainor-just-a-friend-to-you/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of

As performed by Meghan Trainor.  Most of the chord charts of this song show standard chords...but it doesn’t take long to play with the recording to realize that Meghan Trainor uses some modified (but not overly difficult) chords instead of 1st position chords on the ukulele.  This play along attempts to follow her chords as much as possible. Look for an added note (1st string, 3rd fret) through much of the song.  And in the final progressions, Play Fm to C by leaving C with your 4th finger (pinky).  This should be a nice song to challenge players who are ready to start playing beyond 1st position.  Enjoy!

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"
