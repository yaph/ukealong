As performed by Meghan Trainor.  Most of the chord charts of this song show standard chords...but it doesn’t take long to play with the recording to realize that Meghan Trainor uses some modified (but not overly difficult) chords instead of 1st position chords on the ukulele.  This play along attempts to follow her chords as much as possible. Look for an added note (1st string, 3rd fret) through much of the song.  And in the final progressions, Play Fm to C by leaving C with your 4th finger (pinky).  This should be a nice song to challenge players who are ready to start playing beyond 1st position.  Enjoy!
