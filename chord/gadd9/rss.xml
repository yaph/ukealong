        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for DGBE ukulele.  Key of G.  Raised a whole step from the original version.

Chords Used: D, D7, G, G (add 9), C, Am, A

From Jim Henson's Bear in the Big Blue House.

This was a request from the comments on the YouTube channel by Christopher Martin.  I made a version in two keys as the original key of F is difficult for some players.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.
