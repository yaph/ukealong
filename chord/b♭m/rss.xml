        <description><![CDATA[Ukulele play along

House Of Gold - Twenty One Pilots

Using the chords: C  F  G  A7  Am  Dm  Bbm
** A good chance to practice the B flat minor chord! **

Suggested Strum Patterns: D DU U DU or D DU DU DU - it is fast

Notes:
Tyler Joseph plays a C chord for the first section (chorus). I have used the chords as a guide to help singing but you can play a C chord if you prefer.

This video is meant for educational purposes.
