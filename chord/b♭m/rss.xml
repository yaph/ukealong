House Of Gold - Twenty One Pilots

Using the chords: C  F  G  A7  Am  Dm  Bbm
** A good chance to practice the B flat minor chord! **

Suggested Strum Patterns: D DU U DU or D DU DU DU - it is fast

Notes:
Tyler Joseph plays a C chord for the first section (chorus). I have used the chords as a guide to help singing but you can play a C chord if you prefer.

        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/varios-artistas-jar-of-hearts/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  Transposed up a whole step from the original in Eb.

As performed by Christina Perri.

What an absolutely gorgeous song.  The bridge is stunning, and the ending going from dim7 to tonic is outstanding.  And it works well with the ukulele.  I may try placing this in G, which would be even easier to play on the ukulele—not sure how it will sound in that key (transposed up two whole steps).  The tricky chords are the Bb and the Bbm, and as things go, those aren’t too bad.

The audio has been adjusted to move from the original Key of E to F, and then to remove the key change at the end.  Note the barre chords: Bbm, Bb, F, and Fmaj7 (These last two occur at the end)

        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/burn-the-ballroom-crazy/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational purposes--all rights remain with the group.

"Crazy" by Burn the Ballroom.  In the Key of F (F, A, Dm, Bb, Bbm, C, C7).  I heard this song as bumper music on the Tony Kornheiser Show--and it stick in my head as a great song for a ukulele play along.  The lyrics may not be appropriate for young students.  The melody is wonderful!

This song was fun to work out, as the chords were not readily available on various "tab" websites.

The group's albums and this song can be found on iTunes and Amazon.   You can also access the group's YouTube recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrSlr2LxdDk
