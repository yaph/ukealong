        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.

As performed by Ingrid Michaelson.

I watched Autumn Best’s performance of this song this morning (https://youtu.be/ckcZiDhPYSc) and decided to listen to the original recording—this is a wonderful song with some surprising chords along the way.  Kris Gilbert also has a play along of this video, so check out her version, too (https://youtu.be/FDdVhPdIR_E)

*The Abdim7 should be G#dim7 but I couldn't find the diagram in the chord font I use. Had to use the enharmonic.

As performed by Cristin Milioti (On "How I Met Your Mother")

The audio is from the TV show...not a studio recording.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"
