As performed by Ingrid Michaelson.

I watched Autumn Best’s performance of this song this morning (https://youtu.be/ckcZiDhPYSc) and decided to listen to the original recording—this is a wonderful song with some surprising chords along the way.  Kris Gilbert also has a play along of this video, so check out her version, too (https://youtu.be/FDdVhPdIR_E)
