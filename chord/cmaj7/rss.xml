        <description><![CDATA[Performed by Johnny Cash
Written by Glenn Danzig

Note: The D chord is actually D/A but as the nice people at the ukulele-chords.com let us know: "Altered bass note is already part of the un-slashed chord, it does not make sense to play it on a ukulele."

Also Cmaj7 can be played as a regular C but the former is the one JC uses.]]></description>
