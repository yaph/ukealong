No Time To Die - Billie Eilish
From the James Bond Film

Using the chords: A  Am  B7  Cmaj7  Em

Suggested Strum Pattern:  D D D DU or single strums
You can be quite flexible with the strumming as it is slow

If you prefer, try playing some of the Am and Cmaj7 chords with your 1st finger to make it easier to move to the Em and B7 chords
