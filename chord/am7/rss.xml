        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/i-cant-help-falling-in-love-with-you-ukulele-play-along-in-f/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for CGEA ukulele.  Key of F.

Chords Used: F, Am, Dm, Bb, C, C7, E7, Am7, Gm

See the tutorial video at the "sister" YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/utzxUuJ1YX8

Original performance by me, because the Twenty One Pilots version in C is too high (or too low) for my voice).  I don't make many videos of my own playing/singing for the video play alongs.  It isn't a perfect performance...and that's okay!

Original videos recorded with the Acappella app on iOS.  Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is from ukefarm.com.

The Motion background video is from motionbolt.com
