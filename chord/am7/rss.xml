        <link><![CDATA[http://ukealong.com/song/marvin-gaye,-tammi-terrell-ain't-no-mountain-high-enough/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  I have altered the key from the original by a whole step (lower) and minor third (removing a modulation in the song).

As performed by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.

I heard this a couple of days ago at a St. Paul Saints (independent league) baseball game, and thought about making this play along again.  I had tried in the past, but gave up—it is really hard to get the chords to sound right.  This is my best shot..and I think it works.  There is a quick chord change in the verse...but practice it and you’ll get it.  As mentioned previously, I have lowered the key to Am, and taken away the modulation that happens in the bridge.  Enjoy!
