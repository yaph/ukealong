        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  Raised a whole step from the original (Key of Bb).

From “The Greatest Showman”

My wife and I finally had the chance to see this a couple of weeks ago (bringing our boys) and we both loved the show.  This duet works very well on the ukulele and in this key, isn’t so hard.  In the areas with C and Csus4, you can also throw in some Cadd9 chords (0203) but the C to Csus4 is easy to do and sounds good.

        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/christina-perri-jar-of-hearts-2/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  Transposed up a whole step from the original in Eb.

As performed by Christina Perri.

What an absolutely gorgeous song.  The bridge is stunning, and the ending going from dim7 to tonic is outstanding.  And it works well with the ukulele.  I may try placing this in G, which would be even easier to play on the ukulele—not sure how it will sound in that key (transposed up two whole steps).  The tricky chords are the Bb and the Bbm, and as things go, those aren’t too bad.

        <title><![CDATA[Ingrid Michaelson - You And I - Key of C]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/ingrid-michaelson-you-and-i/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C (original key).

As performed by Ingrid Michaelson.

Check the lyrics as this may not be appropriate for use in a school setting (i.e. “do what the bunnies do,” and “spoon.”).

This version Includes some of the color chords (Fadd9) that Ingrid uses but are not on the chord charts you will find on the internet.  For the Gsus4, play a G chord and add the pinky at the same time.

The original leads to a final chorus that is not accompanied by ukulele.  I ended the play along at that point.  Sorry about the chords there..Ingrid switches to Csus4 to C to Csus4 to C at the end and I didn’t want to add yet another slide.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"
