        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

Chords Used: C, Gsus4, G7, F, D7, Ab, C7

As performed by The Ka'au Crater Boys.

This song has become a part of the traditional ukulele repertoire as a solo (you can find versions on the web if you would like to learn it), but in this case, you will be acting as the "rhythm section" underneath the solo.

I did not create a tutorial for this video, and you can play any strumming pattern that goes along with the rhythm section.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.
