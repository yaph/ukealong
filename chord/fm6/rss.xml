Chords Shown: C, C7, F, Fm6, G7, A7, D7, F#dim7, B7, E7, Fm

As performed by Christopher Davis-Shannon.  Special thanks to him, as he gave me permission to use this song and also provided help with the chords shown.  Incidentally, he plays the song "in C" but on a ukulele tuned up a minor third (i.e. Eb).

Tutorial Video (GCEA & DGBE):

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

This is not the easiest song.  Raised up from the original Key of Bb, and slowed down to about 80% of the original key.

This is an edited video...I had originally forgot to add the list of chords in the song.
