        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.   For GCEA Ukulele.  Key of Eb, but written in C with the intent of the player using a capo on the 3rd Fret.  At the original key.

Chords Shown: C, C7, F, Fm6, G7, A7, D7, F#dim7, B7, E7, Fm

As performed by Christopher Davis-Shannon.  Special thanks to him, as he gave me permission to use this song and also provided help with the chords shown.  Incidentally, he plays the song "in C" but on a ukulele tuned up a minor third (i.e. Eb).

Tutorial Video (GCEA & DGBE):

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.

        <title><![CDATA[Sesame Street - Bein' Green - Key of C]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/sesame-street-bein-green/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

This is not the easiest song.  Raised up from the original Key of Bb, and slowed down to about 80% of the original key.

This is an edited video...I had originally forgot to add the list of chords in the song.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"
