        <description><![CDATA[From the Jive Aces..."Bring Me Sunshine."  The song uses a lot of chords, starting in Bb (Bb, Cm, F7, Bb7, C7, Eb) and then modulating with a change of tempo to C (C, Dm, G7, C7, D7, F).  If working with beginners, try starting at the faster tempo where it changes to C.

This appears for educational use...please support the Jive Aces (who use ukulele) by downloading their albums and songs.

The audio comes from the official Jive Aces video (only the music used):

I created the printed lyrics on Keynote, edited in iMovie.  Transparency of the sun icon was created in Preview.  The chords that are used are a part of the Chordette for Education fonts from ukefarm.com.]]></description>
