        <title><![CDATA[Children's Cartoon All-Stars - Conjunction Junction - Key of G]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/children-s-cartoon-all-stars-conjunction-junction/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.

As performed on Schoolhouse Rock.

This past week, the creator of Schoolhouse Rock (Bob Dorough) passed away.  I remember seeing these cartoons throughout my childhood (I was born in the 70s), and while they weren’t my favorite, we didn’t have YouTube or Cable, and you just watched them anyway.  Of all the Schoolhouse Rock cartoons, this was probably my favorite.  So, consider this a tribute to the work of Bob Dorough, as well as growing up in the 1970s.

As performed by Gael García Bernal and Gabriella Flores and Libertad García Fonzi.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS ukulele strings.

This version matches the educational Color Chord approach and uses four chords: C (red sticker), G (green stickers), F (yellow stickers) and Am (blue sticker).

        <title><![CDATA[The Jive Aces - Bring Me Sunshine - Key of Bb, C]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/the-jive-aces-bring-me-sunshine/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[From the Jive Aces..."Bring Me Sunshine."  The song uses a lot of chords, starting in Bb (Bb, Cm, F7, Bb7, C7, Eb) and then modulating with a change of tempo to C (C, Dm, G7, C7, D7, F).  If working with beginners, try starting at the faster tempo where it changes to C.

This appears for educational use...please support the Jive Aces (who use ukulele) by downloading their albums and songs.

The audio comes from the official Jive Aces video (only the music used):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXvJ8UquYoo

I created the printed lyrics on Keynote, edited in iMovie.  Transparency of the sun icon was created in Preview.  The chords that are used are a part of the Chordette for Education fonts from ukefarm.com.]]></description>
