        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  Lowered a minor third from the original.

As performed by Randy Newman.

I have wanted to arrange this for some time.  Another video play along showed chords that didn’t match the music (!).  Randy Newman is incredible, and the original chords are tough on ukulele.  I lowered the key to make it work better for ukulele, and there are some chords that I chose that work—but are definitely not the original chord (D#dim and Dm in the intro).  That said, these chords work with the recording—and could be taken away from the recording and performed live.  I might make a chord sheet for this one.

Dedicated to my friend and college roommate, David, who loved Toy Story.  Incidentally, one of my sons is named Andy and had both Woody and Buzz (we didn’t name him after Toy Story...going for the full name “Andrew”)

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
