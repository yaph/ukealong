Original performance by George Harrison

Our local ukulele group is working on this song, and I was asked to check out the chords they are using (and the tablature they are using), and I made a play along video (there is no tablature in this song).

Tutorial Video (History, GCEA chords, & strumming) on the sister channel (please subscribe!): https://youtu.be/8bll9-iQLW8

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The baritone ukulele chord font is from ukefarm.com.
