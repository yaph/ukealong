I raised the pitch of the song up a half-step.
The chord names sound very complicated but they aren't. Check out the beginning of the video to see how they are so closely related. It's really interesting!

        <description><![CDATA[Chords used:  D, G,  Cadd9  (very easy--only 2 fingers needed to play this chord)
I've lowered the pitch of the song by one half-step to fit the ukelele a bit better.
