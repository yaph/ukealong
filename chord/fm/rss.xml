        <title><![CDATA[Burl Ives - Aunt Rhody]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[http://ukealong.com/song/burl-ives-aunt-rhody/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F and F minor.

As performed by Burl Ives.

Have you ever stopped to wonder why so many of our childhood songs are so dark?  Remember...”Ring Around The Rosy” is supposedly about the Black Plague.

I have been looking for more songs to do, and I want to make sure that we are providing content for beginner players, too.  The directory has a lot of one, two, three, and four chord songs.  But I know there are songs that are missing, so I looked in the table of contents for a ukulele method book, and this song is one of the early songs in that book.

Getting past the depressing lyrics (If Aunt Rhody only cared about the goose for a feather bed, she can still do that, can’t she?), the song is strong from a musical perspective—with two chords in a verse, and switching to minor.  You do need to be able to play f minor—but this song would be an effective way to learn.  It is also a little haunting to hear Burl Ives sing in a minor key—creepy.  Apparently “Resident Evil” used this song as well...so if you use this songs with students, prepare to creep them out.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Cm and C.  Raised a whole step from the original (Bbm and Bb).

As performed by Jaron Everton in “Sing.”

My boys enjoyed Sing and frequently sing this song.  I had started working on but moved on to other videos.  Katie Denure (One Music School) posted a tutorial today (https://youtu.be/m_Xoe9g00oc), which inspired me to wrap up this video.  I took away some of the fast Ab Bb C changes that occur at the end of some phrases...feel free to add them back in your own practice.  This video offers some good Barre chord practice (partial and full) with Cm, Ab, and Bb.

        <link><![CDATA[http://ukealong.com/song/meghan-trainor-just-a-friend-to-you/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of

As performed by Meghan Trainor.  Most of the chord charts of this song show standard chords...but it doesn’t take long to play with the recording to realize that Meghan Trainor uses some modified (but not overly difficult) chords instead of 1st position chords on the ukulele.  This play along attempts to follow her chords as much as possible. Look for an added note (1st string, 3rd fret) through much of the song.  And in the final progressions, Play Fm to C by leaving C with your 4th finger (pinky).  This should be a nice song to challenge players who are ready to start playing beyond 1st position.  Enjoy!

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"
