Chords Used: C, F

Born in the USA by Bruce Springsteen.  It’s been digitally raised by 1 semitone so beginner ukulele students can play along.   The chords have been added to a lyric video by YouTuber TheFreak093, which may be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3lmb... .  If I were teaching this I would be tempted to turn off the projector and work with counting 16 beats of each chord (changing ever 16 beats from C to F).
