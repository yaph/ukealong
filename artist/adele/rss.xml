        <description><![CDATA[Send My Love To Your New Lover by Adele.  It’s been lowered by 2 semitones so beginner ukulele players can play along.  Chord used: C and Am.  The lyric video was created and posted by YouTuber Lyrics and More, I simply added the chords.  For educational use.

You could also play along with boomwhackers or handbells or guitar or most any instrument that can make a C chord and an A minor chord.
