        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of D and F...18 chords in all!  I was originally considering changing the key...but the original key is about as ukulele friendly as you are going to find, even with some expanded chords.  I think these chords work better than most of the written chord charts you will find for this song on the Internet.  Enjoy!

As performed in Aladdin!

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
