        <description><![CDATA[The Lazy Song by Bruno Mars.  It’s been lowered by 4 semitones so beginner ukulele students can play along.  The lyric video was created by YouTuber gizmothing1, I digitally lowered the recording so you can play it without a capo and added the ukulele chord diagrams.  The original lyric video may be found here - https://youtu.be/k1_26Iayp1s .  For educational use.  Chords Used: G C D B7 Am Bm Em

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Bruno Mars.

Time for a good question: Why make this play along when others have done so?  Simple answer...I had to make a practice track for my choirs and the end result was a file so close to the original that it took less than 10 minutes to edit and render the video to YouTube.  In addition, this video utilizes all of the techniques that I have been learning over the last year of making videos.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
