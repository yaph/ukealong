        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.

As performed by Toto.  Transposed up a half step from the original in E.  This key works well..Gm transitions nicely to Eb, Bb to Dm or F is a practical transition as well.

I forgot to include F as one of the eight chords you need to know...please forgive the error...it just isn’t worth exporting and uploading the video to correct it.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.]]></description>
