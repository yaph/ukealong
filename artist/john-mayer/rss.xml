        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Key of C: C, F, G, Am.  as performed by John Mayer.

Inspired by this cover by Jordan Kiener: https://youtu.be/3Gqz5nXDsPs

This video is unique as it was created 100% on my iPad Pro, using the LumaFusion editing app (and Pixelmator to make some transparent PNGs, Dropbox, and AnyFont--as well as Chordette for Education for ukulele chord fonts--available at ukefarm.com).

One note...during the longer instrumental break, I have the chords switching from F to G.  You could make the case that it should be Dm to G, which is a difference of one note on the ukulele.  However, the whole break is an extension of the previously sung lyrics over F and G...and in the interest of keeping 4 chords (no G7!), I went with F to G.]]></description>
