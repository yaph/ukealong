        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.

Here’s a lesson on barre chords, using the theme to Gilligan’s Island.  A lot of people may not know this show, but as I grew up, this show was one of the shows in syndication—and I watched it every afternoon.  Here’s a great way to learn some barre chords (only two shapes, the “Am” and the “A” shapes).  The second half of the song (ending credits) moves quite a bit faster.  Don’t forget that you can use YouTube’s tools to slow down a video and retain the pitch.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
