        <description><![CDATA[Performed by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole.
Written by Harold Arlen & E.Y. Harburg / George David Weiss & Bob Thiele & Israel Kamakawiwo'ole

The ukulele song for me and I guess for countless others. It got me into uke playing so I wanted to make a easy-to-follow version for other Iz fans out there.

The picture is of young Iz. I don't have the info of the photographer but I hope they will not mind me using it here. Iz has gone behind the rainbow long ago but I can't help wondering if he, as a kid or even later on in his life, ever dreamed of becoming the much loved artist he grew up to be.

I wanted to make a version where you can follow either chord markings in the text of the regular ones at the bottom of the video (or both).

For strumming help, see this helpful video from the wonderful Cynthia Lin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqDiaZ-pqyA

Note: The rather complicated Dm7 can be played as a regular Dm as well.]]></description>
