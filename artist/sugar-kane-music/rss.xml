I just changed the key to G to make it easier to fit on the Uke.

Lyrics and graphics taken straight from this website:
http://www.lilac-lane.org/gumtrees.html

(Chorus)
Christmas Where the Gumtrees Grow,
there is no frost
and there is no snow,
Christmas in Australia's hot,
cold and frosty's what it's not,



when the bloom
of the Jacaranda tree is here,
Christmas time is near.



1. From England came
our Christmas fare,
they even said what
Santa should wear,
But here down under
for summer's cool,
Santa should dip
in a swimming pool.
(Chorus)




2. Santa rides in a sleigh on snow,
but down here
where the gumtrees grow,
Santa should wear some water skis,
and glide around Australia with ease.
(Chorus)



3. To ride around the bush
where it's dry,
to cart all the presents
piled up high,
a red nosed reindeer
would never do,
Santa should jump
on a kangaroo.
(Chorus)]]></description>
