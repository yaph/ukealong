        <description><![CDATA[All My Hope by David Crowder.  It’s been lowered by 1 semitone so children's handbells and deskbells can play along.   If you’ve ever used the Kristal Bell method, it’s just like that but easier as your "note" stays in place!  Hand out the color coded bells and tell the kids to shake them when their color/letter is highlighted!

Notes / Bells Used: C D E G A B C (all diatonic notes EXCEPT F).  If you want to get fancy feel free to add an F# to the D7 chords and a C# to the A7 chords.

For educational use.
