        <title><![CDATA[Taylor Swift - Shake It Off ]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/taylor-swift-shake-it-off/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Taylor Swift.

This version is slightly modified from a play along by Dr. Jill Reese (https://youtu.be/U83hQHfELNg).  I wanted to use the colored strings that match KIDS/DR Multi-Color strings, and threw in the color “boxes” that represent the color chords on Kala’s new Color Chord Ukuleles.  I also took out Taylor Swift’s spoken part in the middle of the song...I generally want to keep my students playing rather than sitting and waiting or using the ukuleles as a drum.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS and DR Multi-Color ukulele strings.

This version matches the educational Color Chord approach and uses four chords: C (red sticker), G (green stickers), F (yellow stickers) and Am (blue sticker).
