        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/elizabeth-mitchell-this-land-is-your-land/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[A Ukulele Play Along version of This Land Is Your Land in the Key of C (F, C, G7).  Song by Woody Guthrie, performance by Elizabeth Mitchell.   For educational purposes.  Audio edited to just include a few verses from this lyric video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRnHx3yVuf4.

Many of the ukulele play alongs are created with pop music to keep students engaged.  I am 100% behind that effort--however, I am trying to bring songs that are often used at ukulele jam sessions to this format as well, so that all players can become material with some of the more common "ukulele songs" and sing and play together.

The chord fonts used in this set come from Chordette for Education, from ukefarm.com]]></description>
