        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Caspar Babypants and modified with permission to make the song easy for many schools to use (and better to sing, as the original is in A and is MUCH lower).

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for DGBE ukulele.  Key of A.

As performed by Caspar Babypants (Chris Ballew), used with permission!  (Thanks, Caspar Babypants!)

On babypantsmusic.com, Caspar Babypants describes the inspiration for this song:

"I was watching a documentary about George Harrison and in that documentary Tom Petty told a story about George coming to his house to give him a ukulele. George and Tom strolled through the garden playing ukuleles having a grand old time. When George went to leave he asked Tom if he wanted more ukuleles. Tom said he was okay with one ukulele but George insisted and opened the trunk of his car to reveal a HUGE pile of ukuleles. The moment Tom Petty finished telling the story I realized I had to write a song about this incredible moment. I think it's good advice to always keep a ukulele within arms reach! You never know when you need to elevate your mood with the sparkly sound of a uke."

This song is much easier to play on a baritone ukulele than on a soprano/concert/tenor ukulele.

I really like this song for a number of reasons.  First, it pays tribute to George Harrison, one of the Beatles.  The song also pays tribute in its actual sound, which is reminiscent (to me) to "Yellow Submarine."  Second, the song is about ukuleles.  Finally, the song offers some opportunities to stretch your playing ability with some more difficult chords (C#min, F#7) and some fingerpicking.
