        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Caspar Babypants and modified with permission to make the song easy for many schools to use (and better to sing, as the original is in A and is MUCH lower).

Tutorial video for GCEA ukulele: https://youtu.be/s6Q0aXQq_Eg

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Baritone Ukulele, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Spotify, and Stitcher.
