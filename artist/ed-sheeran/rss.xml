        <description><![CDATA[Friends! This video is dedicated to the premiere season 8 of the Game of Thrones.
During a trip to the Riverlands, Arya stumbles upon the Lanister soldiers who perform this song. In the A Song of Ice and Fire, the authorship of this song is attributed to the bard Simon Silver Tongue. In it is sung about the secret romance of Tyrion and Shae. The role of one of the soldiers acting by Ed Sheeran, it was a kind of surprise for Messi Williams, as she is a fan of Sheeran's work.

        <title><![CDATA[Ed Sheeran - Photograph - Key of F]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/ed-sheeran-photograph/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  Original key is E, so raised a half step for ukulele friendliness.

As performed by Ed Sheeran.

I’ll be honest...this one was tricky. In looking up the chords, a lot of sites have this in D.  That is great...because with a four chord song, I can drop it a whole step and make it beginner friendly with C, Am, F, and G...the “Color Chords (see Kala’s new ukulele).”  Well, I lowered the pitch and things weren’t right...the intro tab had sharps (in C?) and I quickly realized that several sites had ALREADY lowered the pitch for ukulele.  The song was originally in E.  Why E?  It is a great, rich key on the guitar (lots of open strings) and some voices (like Sheeran’s) fit well in the key.  So...I could have gone with D (D, Bm, G, A) or F...but D is a whole step transition, so I went UP the half step to F (F, Dm, Bb, C). I think that’s the right choice, unless you want to play in Sheeran’s original key playing in D (with a Bm barre chord) and using a capo on the 2nd Fret.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"
