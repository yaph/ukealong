        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  Transposed up from the original Key of E.  If you want to learn the song in the original key, I would suggest learning the chords in the Key of C and using a capo to move to E.  I considered making a play along in C, but the voice became too warped.

As performed by Train

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!
