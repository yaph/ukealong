        <description><![CDATA[Calling All Angles by Train.  It’s been lowered by 3 semitones so beginner ukulele players can play along.  Chords used: G, C, F, Am, and Dm.  The lyric video was created and posted by YouTuber Earthquaker, I simply added the chords.  For educational use.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  Transposed up from the original Key of E.  If you want to learn the song in the original key, I would suggest learning the chords in the Key of C and using a capo to move to E.  I considered making a play along in C, but the voice became too warped.
