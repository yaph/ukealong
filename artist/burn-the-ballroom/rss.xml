        <description><![CDATA[For educational purposes--all rights remain with the group.

"Crazy" by Burn the Ballroom.  In the Key of F (F, A, Dm, Bb, Bbm, C, C7).  I heard this song as bumper music on the Tony Kornheiser Show--and it stick in my head as a great song for a ukulele play along.  The lyrics may not be appropriate for young students.  The melody is wonderful!

This song was fun to work out, as the chords were not readily available on various "tab" websites.

The group's albums and this song can be found on iTunes and Amazon.   You can also access the group's YouTube recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrSlr2LxdDk

The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com]]></description>
