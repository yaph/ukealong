        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F, lowered from the original key of A.  While the chords change fast, this is the easiest key to play the song on GCEA tuned ukulele.

As performed by Zedd, featuring Elley Duhé.

Many thanks to Katie Wardrobe from Midnight Music, www.midnightmusic.com.au, for the song suggestion.
