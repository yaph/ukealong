        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Anna Kendrick.

This song was first put to a ukulele play along by Dr. A  (https://youtu.be/JGI1LWfFIZQ).    I have worried about the “Whiskey” line in the past, but I am not worrying about it any more (in a live performance I might substitute “root beer” for students).  I wanted a version without the long cup sequence of the official “Cups” video (students were banging on their ukuleles) and to bring the common look that is shared by most of my videos.  The use of colored strings and Color Chord (plus the cups in the video) was a bonus.

The song has banjo and ukulele.  The ukulele adds an Fm in the final harmonic sequence...but this is being kept to four chords for beginners.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS and DR Multi-Color ukulele strings.

This version matches the educational Color Chord approach and uses four chords: C (red sticker), G (green stickers), F (yellow stickers) and Am (blue sticker).

Are these ukulele resources valuable to you?  If so, consider following my blog at ukestuff.info, and becoming a patron at www.patreon.com/cjrphd.  There is a master list of all similar play along videos at ukestuff.info.]]></description>
