        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Created with letter names so any non-transposing instrument can play along.   Key of D.  Lowered a half step from the original.

As performed by Florida Georgia Line.

This was a request from the comments on this YouTube channel.  The song is edited to remove the verse with the swear word so that it can be used in all settings (e.g. schools).  Versions for Baritone Ukulele, Ukulele in F, and Ukulele in D are also available.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.

The motion background is a free resource from Videos2Worship.

There is a master list of all similar play along videos at my blog: ukestuff.info.  Access to the blog, and all materials on the blog is free.
