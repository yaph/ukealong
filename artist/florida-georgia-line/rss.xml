        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  Raised a whole step from the original.

As performed by Florida Georgia Line.

This was a request from the comments on this YouTube channel.  The song is edited to remove the verse with the swear word so that it can be used in all settings (e.g. schools).  Versions for Baritone Ukulele, Lyrics (Chords as letter names), and a version for Ukulele in D are also available.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The motion background is a free resource from Videos2Worship.

There is a master list of all similar play along videos at my blog: ukestuff.info.  Access to the blog, and all materials on the blog is free.
