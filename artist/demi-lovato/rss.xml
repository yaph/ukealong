        <description><![CDATA[This tutorial will show you how to play Sober on the ukulele by Demi Lovato. The chords used are C F G Am.

*Note - this video contains mature subject matter, no foul language. It's not a video I usually do but with so many people struggling with addictions, mental health issues and just struggling with life, I found the raw emotions and openness compelling.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G (Original Key)

As performed by Demi Lovato.

I also created a play along of “Let It Go” from the movie Frozen, but there are a few more twists and turns harmonically in that version (https://youtu.be/FyyWuj-jS1U).

There is one part of a verse in this version where a Dm and Cm are substituted for D and C...that’s kind of fun...watch for it.
