        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  As performed by Larry Groce and the Disneyland Children's Sing-Along Chorus.  Original video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlk6fjZ0nf4

The original version of this song is in G, and the audio has been lowered a whole step to be in the Key of F (this Key was a special request).  Look for the version in G as well, as that is also a good key for ukulele..

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com]]></description>
