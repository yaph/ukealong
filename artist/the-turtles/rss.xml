        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  In the Key of Gm/G (it switches back and forth) with Gm, F, Eb (D#), G, D, Dm, Bb (A#).  The original song is in F#m/F#, so the song has been raised a half step to facilitate playing on the ukulele.

The original video can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M69nNFLA1wA, with a nod to Mookie's Play Along Songs.

The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukestuff.info]]></description>
