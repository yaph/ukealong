        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Key of F: F, Bb, Dm, C.  I used the original Jeremy Messersmith recording (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLP9f4jsq0M).  Please visit jeremymessersmith.com where you can download the entire songbook of 11 Obscenely Optimistic Songs for Ukulele for free...and support him by buying the album on iTunes or Amazon.

Try jeremy's strumming pattern of all downbeats, putting an emphasis on 1, + of two , and 4...making 4/4 time feel like 123 123 12.
