        <description><![CDATA[Satisfied from Hamilton.  It’s been lowered by 3 semitones so beginner ukulele players can play along.  Chord used: Am, D, F, and E7.  The lyric video was created and posted by YouTuber LyricsBy Allie, I simply added the chords.  The simplified chords were inspired by YouTuber Cory Teaches Music.  For educational use.
