        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.




As performed by Kenny Loggins.  The pitch has been lowered to make it playable by young ukulele students.

Chords Used:
• Mostly Dm & C
• There's one Gm, one F, and one A
• There are technically some Bb’s in the song, but I just simplified and put Dm’s there as my students do not know Bb.
