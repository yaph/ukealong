        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  Two steps higher than the original (pushing the edge of audio transposition)!

As performed by Christina Perri.

There is a version in F which requires barre chords.  This version does not.

What an absolutely gorgeous song.  The bridge is stunning, and the ending going from dim7 to tonic is outstanding.  And it works well with the ukulele.  I may try placing this in G, which would be even easier to play on the ukulele—not sure how it will sound in that key (transposed up two whole steps).  The tricky chords are the Bb and the Bbm, and as things go, those aren’t too bad.

I'll be honest..this was a fun one to work on.  It is shifted up a whole step from the original recording.   None of the online lead sheets matched what I was hearing..and I tried to incorporate some of the passing tones with chords like Cmaj7.  In this key, the song is pretty straightforward and fun to play.  Listen to the song for strumming pattern ideas (e.g. single strums at the beginning).

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"
