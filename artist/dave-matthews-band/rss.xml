        <description><![CDATA[Ukulele Play Along guide with chords and optional improvisation suggestion.

Chords used:  D,  G,  Em,  A7sus (a two-finger chord, very easy because it occurs right after Em and involves just modifying the Em chord)

Improv section is a modified blues scale.

I do not own the copyright to this music.
Ant pictures were adapted from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKrmIgmuDnk
