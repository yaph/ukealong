        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Larry Groce.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS and DR Multi-Color ukulele strings.

This version matches the educational Color Chord approach and uses four chords: C (red sticker), G (green stickers), F (yellow stickers) and Am (blue sticker).

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  As performed by Larry Groce and the Disneyland Children's Sing-Along Chorus.  Original video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlk6fjZ0nf4

The original version of this song is in G, and the audio has been lowered a whole step to be in the Key of F (this Key was a special request).  Look for the version in G as well, as that is also a good key for ukulele..
