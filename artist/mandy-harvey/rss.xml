        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of A.

As performed by Mandy Harvey on America's Got Talent (2017)

This is a great song to learn F#m, and Mandy chose a Dsus2 instead of a standard D chord.  It is a nice departure from songs in C, F, and G (an overwhelming number of ukulele songs are written or transposed to these keys).

If you are playing this during AGT 2017, keep voting for Mandy--and she has a new book out about her life.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.]]></description>
