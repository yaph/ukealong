Uses a version of the song without (or with reduced) voices to encourage your own singing while still having a “backing track” available?  Want a version with the voices?Look for a similar song with “Ukulele Play Along.”

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
