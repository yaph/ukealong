        <description><![CDATA[A ukulele play along of "Waltzing Matilda" in the key of C: C, G7, Am, F.

I chose to make this song into a play along as it is commonly requested at a local jam session.  While I want to continue to prepare pop tunes for students, I also want them to learn some of the folk tradition and common literature played in ukulele groups.

For this song, I used the audio track by Slim Dusty from this lyric YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2DSil5RriU

I had to lower the audio by a whole step to get into the Key of C (I also had to raise the pitch a bit to get it in tune with A440).

I didn't want to use the original video as the text was impossible to read and the words didn't match the singer's words.

As there are a number of Australian terms in the song, I also included the information about the song from Rolf Harris on this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEVKUE_ma00

Finally, the font used for ukulele chords is Chordette for Education, available from ukefarm.com]]></description>
