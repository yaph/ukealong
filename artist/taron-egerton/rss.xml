        <link><![CDATA[http://ukealong.com/song/taron-egerton-i'm-still-standing/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Cm and C.  Raised a whole step from the original (Bbm and Bb).

As performed by Jaron Everton in “Sing.”

My boys enjoyed Sing and frequently sing this song.  I had started working on but moved on to other videos.  Katie Denure (One Music School) posted a tutorial today (https://youtu.be/m_Xoe9g00oc), which inspired me to wrap up this video.  I took away some of the fast Ab Bb C changes that occur at the end of some phrases...feel free to add them back in your own practice.  This video offers some good Barre chord practice (partial and full) with Cm, Ab, and Bb.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
