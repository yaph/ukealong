As performed by Keith Green.

It is Easter Sunday, 2018.  To celebrate, here is one of my all-time favorite Easter Songs.  There are some challenges in this play along.  The original is in A; this is lowered a whole step to be ukulele-friendly.  Happy Easter!

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
