        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for DGBE ukulele.  Key of G. (Original Key)

As performed by Pink, ft. Nate Ruess.

This song was a request from a comment on the Ukulele Tenor YouTube channel.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is based on Chordette for Education (ukefarm.com).  As there isn't a Baritone Ukulele Education font (yet) I tried making my own in Calligraphr.com.  I still have some spacing to work out, it seems.

There is a master list of all similar play along videos at my blog: ukestuff.info.  Access to the blog, and all materials on the blog is free.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Spotify, and Stitcher.

Are these ukulele resources valuable to you?  If so, consider following my blog at ukestuff.info, and becoming a patron at www.patreon.com/cjrphd.   Patreon rewards include access to my “method” of the video play alongs (to be used in a classroom) as well as some other resources, and starting in 2019, a chord sheet of every song posted as a play along.

Thanks for watching the videos and supporting the channel!]]></description>
