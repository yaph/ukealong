I’m likely going to recreate Jolene with color chord symbols and Color Chord this weekend...and as I hear that song, I think of this song...and the Blues Brothers use of this song.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!
