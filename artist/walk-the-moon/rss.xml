        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  Original is in the key of C#, so this is transposed down a half step.

As performed by Walk the Moon.

There is an existing ukulele play along by Kris Gilbert (https://youtu.be/xEKih60D4VI) whose play alongs follow an indication of event over notated time signature.  Be sure to check out her channel and her videos.

This version adds colored strings and Color Chord.  The chorus uses an technique where chords that are on beat one and three are where they are expected,  yet the other chords that would traditionally fall on beats two and four precede/anticipate the beat.  Play through the video and you’ll see what this is all about.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS and DR Multi-Color ukulele strings.

This version matches the educational Color Chord approach and uses four chords: C (red sticker), G (green stickers), F (yellow stickers) and Am (blue sticker).

Are these ukulele resources valuable to you?  If so, consider following my blog at ukestuff.info, and becoming a patron at www.patreon.com/cjrphd.  There is a master list of all similar play along videos at ukestuff.info.]]></description>
