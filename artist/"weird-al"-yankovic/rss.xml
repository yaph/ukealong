        <description><![CDATA[This is so cool. The song belongs to Weird Al Yankavic with the lyrics consisting of A palindrome. Palindromes are a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which can be read  backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers. The music video is a tribute to Bob Dylan's song Subterranean Homesick Blues.
