        <description><![CDATA[Ukulele play along of Stitches by Shawn Mendes - Am G C F (original song transposed down half step to fit ukulele)

The part just before the chorus has slightly different chords... watch the video carefully!
Can be played with D-U-U-U-U strumming or following the finger picking guide. This is a decent song for beginners to practice figuring out tab and finger picking, but speed is the main issue.
