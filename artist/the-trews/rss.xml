        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by The Trews.

A special request for a school in Ontario, Canada, that is performing this song for Remembrance Day.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS and DR Multi-Color ukulele strings.

This version matches the educational Color Chord approach and uses four chords: C (red sticker), G (green stickers), F (yellow stickers) and Am (blue sticker).
