        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  In the original key.

As performed by Michael W. Smith.

This is one of my favorite worship songs...and it brings the Kyrie from the old traditions of the church to the present...in a way that evangelicals can join our liturgical family in worship.

The chords move fast, and I used some alternative fingerings of some chords because they sounded better (to me).

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
