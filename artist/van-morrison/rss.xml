        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.

As performed by Van Morrison.

This song is already a play along by Dr. Jill Reese.  I wanted to place it in the "rolling" follow along style.  Her original video: https://youtu.be/vYqF7NcdIGM

It was a bit of a challenge to get this one ready...it involved uploading, interaction about blocking, deleting, importing new audio and adjusting everything again.  In the process, I forgot about the transitions between the chord symbols and "bouncing ball."  Forgive me...but I am not going to update those at the current time.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.]]></description>
