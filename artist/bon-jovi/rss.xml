        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Dm.  Raised a whole step from the original.

As performed by Bon Jovi.  This song was fun to figure out.  I think it turned out pretty well.  The intoductory riff is fun to play...and easy when the song is in Dm.
