        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.

As performed by Walk Off the Earth

I played the original video for my students today and had to make a play along video of the song.  Original (watch it): https://youtu.be/QgD5p1XiVT0

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"
