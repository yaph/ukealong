        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Under the Boardwalk by the Drifters.  In the original Key of G (G, Hawaiian D7, C, Em, G7, and D).  The famous Yellow Book ("The Daily Ukulele")  features this song in C.

This song has some significance in the ukulele world, as it is a common song at jam sessions, and is also the anthem of the Ukulele Club of Santa Cruz, and there is a documentary of that club called, "Under the Boardwalk: A Ukulele Love Story."

The original video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRQm7Yt77k0

The ukulele font comes from Chordette for Education, found at ukefarm.com]]></description>
