As recorded in Mary Poppins.

It has been a while since I have posted a Play Along Video.  Just a little busy with work lately.  Be sure to send requests to my contact info at the ukulele blog.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
