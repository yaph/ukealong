        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/the-soggy-bottom-boys-in-the-jailhouse-now/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Best with GCEA tuned ukuleles (based on the chords charts used). Key of C: C, F, Hawaiian D7, G.

As performed by the Soggy Bottom Boys, transposed up a little more than 1/2 step to the Key of C.

This is another song in the Tampa Bay Ukulele Society Beginner Workbook.

Created 100% on iPad using Luma Fusion.  Also using iCab Mobile, Twisted Wave, and Any Font.

The ukulele chords are Chordette for Education, available from ukefarm.com]]></description>
