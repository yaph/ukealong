As performed by Lenka.

Kevin Way created a wonderful play along video for this song.  https://youtu.be/gTNBXwIO81M. I am so glad that he did.  My students have been asking for a version that is easier to read on our dim projector, as well as for the colored string charts.  So...here is a updated version (same chords) with colored strings and Color Chord “boxes.”

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS and DR Multi-Color ukulele strings.

This version matches the educational Color Chord approach and uses four chords: C (red sticker), G (green stickers), F (yellow stickers) and Am (blue sticker).
