Laurie (individually or with her band) does a great job with children's songs.  Please support her work with purchases from iTunes or Amazon; you can also find her work on Apple Music.  All rights remain with Laurie Berkner.

This is another song that is part of the Tampa Bay Ukulele Society Beginner Packet.

Created 100% on the iPad Pro.  Main tool: Luma Fusion, along with AnyFont and the ukulele chords from Chordette for Education from ukefarm.com]]></description>
