This is a great song to practice using your pinky!  Leave the pinky finger on the first string, third fret, all the time!

This song was in the movie Trolls, and one of my son’s friends came over the other day, and as we opened the door, he savant, “Hello darkness, my old friend.”  Yep...had to make a play along.

        <title><![CDATA[Simon & Garfunkel - Cecilia (Single Mix)]]></title>

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Simon and Garfunkel.

Dr. Jill Reese, creator of this style of play along, has a full version of Cecilia (https://youtu.be/B1l8YP2ZfrI)  I was uncomfortable with the second verse in an educational setting and removed it.  This is also Simon and Garfunkel’s version, tweaked in pitch to match standard tuning—but the original recording itself wavers in pitch quite a bit.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"
