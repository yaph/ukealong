        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C

As performed by Fats Domino.  I have wanted to do this since hearing about his death on October 24, 2017 (Today is 11/03/2017).  Some of the chords are ambiguous, but the chords as presented work OK.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.]]></description>
