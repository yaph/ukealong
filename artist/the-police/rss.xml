        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  The original is in Ab (a little sharp), and this has been lowered just a touch more than a half step (125 cents).

As performed by The Police (before Sting went solo).  I heard this on a radio show today and said, “I need to make this into a play along.”  This was the biggest single of 1983 in the U.S. and the U.K.
