        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am (Am, C, G, F, & Dm).  Lowered a major third from the original in C# minor.

As performed by OneRepublic

I have a play along of this song in D minor (published August 2, 2017).  A teacher asked for a version in Am, and at the time I wasn’t archiving old videos, so I had to recreate this video.  I have tried to make fewer slide transitions, but this results in smaller text...hope that’s okay.
