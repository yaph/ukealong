        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  (Original Key).

There is a new version of this play along available, with more detail (single notes included, exact arpeggiated D chord).  Visit: https://youtu.be/zLRuPZj0lYU

Also available: a tutorial on the sister site of this channel: https://youtu.be/ewuvUPrfSks

This works very well with ukulele.  If you ever want to play the single low notes that occur before a verse or chorus, just hit the 3rd string.

As performed by Ruth B.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
