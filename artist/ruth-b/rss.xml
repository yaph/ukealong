        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/ruth-b-lost-boy-4/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  (Original Key).

There is a new version of this play along available, with more detail (single notes included, exact arpeggiated D chord).  Visit: https://youtu.be/zLRuPZj0lYU

Also available: a tutorial on the sister site of this channel: https://youtu.be/ewuvUPrfSks

This works very well with ukulele.  If you ever want to play the single low notes that occur before a verse or chorus, just hit the 3rd string.
