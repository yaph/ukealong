        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  The original is in D, so this is lowered by a whole step.  This uses four standard chords taught in most elementary ukulele methods!  (Am, F, G, C)

As seen in “The Greatest Showman.”  Go see it, and buy the DVD/Digital Version when it comes out!

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
