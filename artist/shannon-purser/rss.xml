        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for DGBE ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Shannon Purser.  From “Sierra Burgess is a Loser.”  A choir director on Facebook was recently talking about how her students were playing this song on ukuleles in the choir room and asking to sing the song in their Spring Concert.  I decided to make a play along of the song.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Baritone Ukulele, available at ukefarm.com.

There is a master list of all similar play along videos at my blog: ukestuff.info.  Access to the blog, and all materials on the blog is free.
