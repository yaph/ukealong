        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Do It Like the Zombies Do, from Disney’s Zombie’s 2.  The play along is for any high, low drum, shaker, and clapping.  It could be a djembe with bass & slap, or tubanos, or bongos, or any combination of high & low drums.  I will use it with African drum circle instruments in my classroom.
