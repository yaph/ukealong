To make the chords easier to play, we have transposed the original song one half step higher. We will be uploading a video with the original key and chord charts at a later date.

Chords used: Dm, Bb, C, F

        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/keala-settle-this-is-me/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  The original is in D, so this is lowered by a whole step.  This uses four standard chords taught in most elementary ukulele methods!  (Am, F, G, C)

As seen in “The Greatest Showman.”  Go see it, and buy the DVD/Digital Version when it comes out!

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
