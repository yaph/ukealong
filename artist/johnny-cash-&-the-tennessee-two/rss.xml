        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Folsom Prison Blues by Johnny Cash.  Key of G (G, G7, C, Hawaiian D7).  Note: This is in a higher key than the original song (see the version for the Key of F if interested in singing at the original pitch).  I apologize that this makes Johnny's voice sound a little funny, but these chords approximate the written version in Jim Beloff's "The Daily Ukulele" or "The Yellow Book."

Whenever I attend a ukulele jam, this song is requested.   I am attempting to make play alongs for songs that are fun to play, and for those that are commonly requested at ukulele jams, so that young/new players can feel at home in those jam sessions, being familiar with the "genre" of "popular" ukulele songs.

All rights remain with the music company who holds Johnny Cash's work; any advertisements that appear are for that company--not for this channel.

The ukulele font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com

Created using Keynote (layout, text, & lyrics) Keepvid.com (saving the original YouTube video), Audacity (ripping audio and modifying audio), Preview (working with the transparent "bouncing ball train"), and iMovie (placing the "bouncing ball train" and other edits.]]></description>
