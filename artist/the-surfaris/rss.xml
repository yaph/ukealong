        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by The Ventures.

I was playing some tab music tonight on ukulele and cam across Ukulenny’s Wipeout (http://www.ukulenny.com).  I realized that I had not made a play along of Wipeout, not had anyone else.  Since there are no lyrics, I found free video footage of surfin (with a wipeout) and used it. Thanks to Pixabay, although no attribution is required (https://pixabay.com/en/videos/surfing-waves-surf-riding-368/).

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS and DR Multi-Color ukulele strings.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
