        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  The original is in A, so this is lowered a whole step.

As performed by Peter, Paul, and Mary.

I’m not going to lie...this was a favorite song of mine growing up...and thus my decision to make it a play along.  In G, the hardest chord is Bm (barre chord).  I just read that the makers of Trolls bought the rights to the Puff franchise...so perhaps there will be a new movie about Puff as well as a Justin Timberlake version of this song!

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
