        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  Lowered a half step from the original key.

As performed by Rick Astley.

This song suddenly appeared on the ukutabs top daily request list, so I decided to put it to a video play along format.  The song is pretty famous for its life after its initial popularity, where people would be taken from a website to this song, as a practical joke (Rick-Rolled).  Online chord charts show the use of a FMaj7...which isn’t a very friendly ukulele chord.  All of the notes of F appear in a FMaj7, so I have just left the chords as plain F, G, Em, and Am chords.  I think it works as it is.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
