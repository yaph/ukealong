Surfin' USA - The Beach Boys

This is one of the first songs we learn and the ukuleles in the video match the colour of the chords we use (Rainbow method).

We have been using the original version of this video by Dr Jill Reese which has really helped us, it's just been tweaked a little to match our chord colours.

In the Key Of C Maj

Using the chords: C F G7

Suggested Strum Patterns: D D D D or D DU U DU
