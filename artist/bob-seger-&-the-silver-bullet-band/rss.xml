Chords: G, G7, F, C, Cmaj7, Em, D.  Strum pattern is a bit syncopated. I've added diagrams for the up and down strums.  Hope that's helpful.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  The original is in E, which is a tough key for ukulele.  I considered D (didn’t sound right with the A chord in D), and F brings the challenge of Bb...and my students are learning D right now...so I went with the Key of G, a minor third higher than the original (E is a great key for guitar and baritone ukulele).

As performed by Bob Seger.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS and DR Multi-Color ukulele strings.
