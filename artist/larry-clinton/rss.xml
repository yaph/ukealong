        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  As performed by Larry Clinton and His Orchestra.  In the Key of C ( C, Am, F, G7, Dm, C7, E7, A7, B7), with some surprises in the less familiar portion of the song.

There are some very quick chord changes and chord ambiguity in those same less familiar verses.  These didn't work out as well as I would have hoped for...but the main instructional point is repetition of C, Am, F, G7, following the instructional materials used by the Tampa Bay Ukulele Society.

The original video comes from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNjpTOB4ksY

My apologies to every music teacher who cringes as students play this song on the piano!

The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education from ukefarm.com]]></description>
