        <description><![CDATA[At the request of a subscriber, here's an educational play along video that uses just 2 chords: C and Am.  I have another version of it that has other parts on the screen (drums, boomwhackers, etc) that may be found here (https://youtu.be/5Nt1bF5a3j0), but this version is just for ukulele.]]></description>
