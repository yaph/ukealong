        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C. (Original Key)

The entire song is provided in TAB, which is built off of Dm, G, C, F, and Fm.  F and Fm are in the second position (5553 and 5543, respectively).

As performed by Scarlett Johansson (voice) and Joaquin Pheonix (Ukulele).  Watching the movie, I think he actually played this.

Watch for an upcoming play along version (not tab) of the song itself by the song writer..

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.
