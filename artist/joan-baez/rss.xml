        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  As performed by Joan Baez.  Key of C: C, G7, E7, F.  Original is in the key of C#...the audio has been transposed to the Key of C.

The song was written by the incredible, playing right hand guitar with left hand, American folk artist Elizabeth Cotton.  I did not use her recordings as she did not have a great singing voice and I teach middle school--my students wouldn't get "over' her voice to play the song.  Suggestion: watch Elizabeth Cotten perform this separately in class: https://youtu.be/IUK8emiWabU

I chose to use Joan Baez.  The original can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_wrFI-Kbxk

I am attempting to work on making Play along videos for all of the introductory songs in the Tampa Bay Ukulele Society's beginner handbook, but not all of the songs are in the same key as printed

Video made 100% on my iPad Pro...main tool is Luma Fusion (video editor), also iCabMobile (downloading YouTube audio), Twisted Wave (Transposition), and AnyFont (use ukulele chord fonts in iOS).

The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com]]></description>
