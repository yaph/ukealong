        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of A.  Modulated down from the original key of B.

As performed by Gordon Lightfoot.

I’m posting this on the 42nd Anniversary of the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Want to hear a great, unique, and wonderful interview?  Listen to T.D. Mischke interview a historian (Mr. Gumbinger).  Hint:  T.D. SINGS the questions!  https://youtu.be/hv4yMUKBOX8

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.]]></description>
