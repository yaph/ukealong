        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  Two steps higher than the original (pushing the edge of audio transposition)!

There is a version in F which requires barre chords.  This version does not.

As performed by Christina Perri.

What an absolutely gorgeous song.  The bridge is stunning, and the ending going from dim7 to tonic is outstanding.  And it works well with the ukulele.  I may try placing this in G, which would be even easier to play on the ukulele—not sure how it will sound in that key (transposed up two whole steps).  The tricky chords are the Bb and the Bbm, and as things go, those aren’t too bad.
