        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Chuck Berry, transposed up a whole step.  I had wanted to make this video play along video since hearing about Chuck Berry's passing in March of 2017.  So here it is four months later.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!
