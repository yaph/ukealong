        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of D (Original Key)

As performed by Zach Sobiech.

I have an older version of this song, but a member of the Facebook Ukulele Video Play Along Group asked for the song in a different key, so I re-created it in several versions.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

There is a master list of all similar play along videos at my blog: ukestuff.info.  Access to the blog, and all materials on the blog is free.

Are these ukulele resources valuable to you?  If so, consider following my blog at ukestuff.info, and becoming a patron at www.patreon.com/cjrphd.   Patreon rewards include access to my “method” of the video play alongs (to be used in a classroom) as well as some other resources, and starting in 2019, a chord sheet of every song posted as a play along.
