        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/camila-cabello-senorita-baritone-ukulele/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for DGBE ukulele.  Key of C.

Chords Used: Am, C, F, Em, G

As performed by Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello

The C Chord should probably be a Cmaj7, but that's a bear on baritone ukulele, and the C chord will work just fine.

Tutorial Video (GCEA & DGBE): https://youtu.be/-ADxekOsPqA

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is available at ukefarm.com.   The motion background is from motionbolt.com.  The "clean" version of the song (use in schools may still not be appropriate) is from Polar Records (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjC5XHyK7hE)

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  Transposed up a whole step from the original key.

As performed by Camila Cabello

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS ukulele strings.

This version matches the educational Color Chord approach and uses four chords: C (red sticker), G (green stickers), F (yellow stickers) and Am (blue sticker).
