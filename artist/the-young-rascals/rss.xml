        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  The original is in D, so this version is lowered a whole step.

As performed by The Young Rascals.

I heard this song on the radio the other day, and thought it would be fun as a play along.  It is...but the chords in D didn’t sound right (different inversions than the original).  The chords move fast, and it was tough to get all of the changes in.  Think you can play C, F, and G?  Here’s your real world authentic test (Yes, there is a D or two...but there is no speed needed to play it).

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
