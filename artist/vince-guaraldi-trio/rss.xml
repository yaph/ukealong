        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  But it is a jazz song, so who really knows.

As performed by The Vince Guaraldi Trio

Okay...NOT the easiest song, and certainly not something you will use with beginners...however, this is a roadmap in the original Key that is playable with practice...and really, who doesn't want this in their repertoire?

Need to take it slower?  Use the gear icon on the video to slow the speed!
