        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Dm.

As performed by Michael Bublé.

The original shifts up a half step at the end...this version stays in Dm.  This is a great song to play/sing!

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

        <description><![CDATA[As performed by Michael Bublé.

Chords for song: C  Dm  Em  F  G  Am  Bm7(which is a substitution for Bm)  and Gbm(F#m) which only occurs twice.

Lots of chord changes!
