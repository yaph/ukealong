        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Werner Thomas.

After seeing the video by David Allen, I wanted to get it in this format...and now my five year old is doing this at school and is coming home and having us dance with him...so it was time to put this video together.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS ukulele strings.]]></description>
