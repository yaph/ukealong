        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  In the key of Am (lowered a minor third), to make the song more ukulele friendly.

As performed by Justin Timberlake and Chris Stapleton.

Thanks to Katie Wardrobe, from Midnight Music (www.midnightmusic.com.au) for suggesting this song.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
