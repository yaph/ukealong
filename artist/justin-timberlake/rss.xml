        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.

This tutorial will show you how to play the chords for Can’t Stop The Feeling by Justin Timberlake on Boomwhackers.  I recommend having students start by hitting once per chord, and then progressing to hitting quarter notes with the beat of the song once the get the hang of it.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  In the key of Am (lowered a minor third), to make the song more ukulele friendly.

As performed by Justin Timberlake and Chris Stapleton.

Thanks to Katie Wardrobe, from Midnight Music (www.midnightmusic.com.au) for suggesting this song.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
