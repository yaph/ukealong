        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of D (Originally in D#, so lowered a half step).

As performed by Nick Lucas.

One my initial goals with the Play Along Videos was to bridge the music that is typically played at ukulele jam sessions so that younger players who might not know the songs could experience some of the epertoire before attending a jam session.  I attended a jam session on 3/30/18, and this was one of the songs and is one of the songs that is played every time I go to a jam session.  If you haven’t heard it, play through it.  The song was originally written in 1921 and has been covered a lot, even by the Beatles.  This version is from 1944.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
