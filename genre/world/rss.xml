        <title><![CDATA[Foster & Allen - Irish Medley - Key of C, F, G]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/foster-allen-irish-medley/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of C, F, and G

The songs in the medley:

When Irish Eyes Are Smiling (In C)
The Black Velvet Band (Modulates to F)
The Boys from County Amargh (Modulates to G)

As performed by Foster & Allen

I wanted to make a play along for “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,” and this version was straightforward—but has two other traditional Irish songs.  And thus a medley play along.  I considered shortening the song—but the keys are straightforward and the hardest chord is a diminished chord.

        <title><![CDATA[Slim Dusty - Waltzing Matilda - Key of C]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/slim-dusty-waltzing-matilda/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[A ukulele play along of "Waltzing Matilda" in the key of C: C, G7, Am, F.

I chose to make this song into a play along as it is commonly requested at a local jam session.  While I want to continue to prepare pop tunes for students, I also want them to learn some of the folk tradition and common literature played in ukulele groups.

For this song, I used the audio track by Slim Dusty from this lyric YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2DSil5RriU

I had to lower the audio by a whole step to get into the Key of C (I also had to raise the pitch a bit to get it in tune with A440).

I didn't want to use the original video as the text was impossible to read and the words didn't match the singer's words.

As there are a number of Australian terms in the song, I also included the information about the song from Rolf Harris on this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEVKUE_ma00
