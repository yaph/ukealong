        <title><![CDATA[Foster & Allen - Irish Medley - Key of C, F, G]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/foster-allen-irish-medley/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of C, F, and G

The songs in the medley:

When Irish Eyes Are Smiling (In C)
The Black Velvet Band (Modulates to F)
The Boys from County Amargh (Modulates to G)

As performed by Foster & Allen

I wanted to make a play along for “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,” and this version was straightforward—but has two other traditional Irish songs.  And thus a medley play along.  I considered shortening the song—but the keys are straightforward and the hardest chord is a diminished chord.

        <title><![CDATA[Lava Ukulele Play Along (Modified Cover) - Key of A]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/lava-ukulele-play-along-modified-cover/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[Key of A.  Performed by me.

Okay...a bit about this particular song.  Since this short came out with Pixar’s “Inside Out,” my students have requested to play along with this song and to sing it.  I tried the existing play alongs, and tried singing the original version with my 6th grade choirs—the result was a mess.  The play along are based on the original audio file, and are really hard to follow because the song slows down and speeds up.  You can see the first such play along by Dr. Jill Reese (https://youtu.be/EDNksuj3dzg) and a very recent version by my friend Andy Ramos (https://youtu.be/kbexjxcLA8E).

As for singing the song, I find (as a tenor) that the original version is too high for me, and too low to drop down an octave.  Therefore, I moved the song down a minor third to A.  You might wonder why I didn’t choose G (G, D7, C).  The D7 chord (Hawaiian or Barre) just doesn’t sound right at that position...whereas the E7 of this version or the original G7 of the original sound better to my ear.  If you want me to make a version in G, e-mail me (visit ukestuff.info), and I’ll be happy to comply.

I also modified the number of verses for my students and shortened the song—the original version just had too many verses for my students to remember—and to be honest, it is hard enough for them to remember the different words of the final chorus.

I have been waiting to do this project, but my voice just hasn’t recuperated fully after getting sick in November.  This is also why I haven’t recorded any more of the 365 Project videos.  I don’t think I am going to recuperate until the school year is over—so I just gave up hopes of a healthy voice and simply ripped out this recording tonight after my boys went to bed.  This recording took two takes—the first take I had forgotten to set GarageBand (iOS) to “automatic” length, so I had to record a second time.  I recorded directly into a Blue Snowball microphone, into my iPhone (USB to lightning cable) on GarageBand, using my 2004 KoAloha concert ukulele.  You can hear some vocal issues (sorry about the super loud note at the end) and some times that my fingers didn’t press quite hard enough to always get a perfect “clean” sound...but this version allows me to have a play along in the key that we sing the song, without the song being too long, and without the tempo speeding up and slowing down.

I dedicate this video to my wife Liz, who is my “lava.”

        <title><![CDATA[Slim Dusty - Waltzing Matilda - Key of C]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/slim-dusty-waltzing-matilda/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[A ukulele play along of "Waltzing Matilda" in the key of C: C, G7, Am, F.

I chose to make this song into a play along as it is commonly requested at a local jam session.  While I want to continue to prepare pop tunes for students, I also want them to learn some of the folk tradition and common literature played in ukulele groups.

For this song, I used the audio track by Slim Dusty from this lyric YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2DSil5RriU

I had to lower the audio by a whole step to get into the Key of C (I also had to raise the pitch a bit to get it in tune with A440).

I didn't want to use the original video as the text was impossible to read and the words didn't match the singer's words.

As there are a number of Australian terms in the song, I also included the information about the song from Rolf Harris on this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEVKUE_ma00
