        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of C, F, and G

The songs in the medley:

When Irish Eyes Are Smiling (In C)
The Black Velvet Band (Modulates to F)
The Boys from County Amargh (Modulates to G)

As performed by Foster & Allen

I wanted to make a play along for “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,” and this version was straightforward—but has two other traditional Irish songs.  And thus a medley play along.  I considered shortening the song—but the keys are straightforward and the hardest chord is a diminished chord.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.

        <title><![CDATA[Slim Dusty - Waltzing Matilda ]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/slim-dusty-waltzing-matilda/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[A ukulele play along of "Waltzing Matilda" in the key of C: C, G7, Am, F.

I chose to make this song into a play along as it is commonly requested at a local jam session.  While I want to continue to prepare pop tunes for students, I also want them to learn some of the folk tradition and common literature played in ukulele groups.

For this song, I used the audio track by Slim Dusty from this lyric YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2DSil5RriU

I had to lower the audio by a whole step to get into the Key of C (I also had to raise the pitch a bit to get it in tune with A440).

I didn't want to use the original video as the text was impossible to read and the words didn't match the singer's words.

As there are a number of Australian terms in the song, I also included the information about the song from Rolf Harris on this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEVKUE_ma00
