Tonight as we were driving back from seeing Incredibles 2, my six year old (fresh out of kindergarten) asked, “Can we sing ‘Elephants Have Wrinkles?’”  So...I did as most fathers would do...I opened Apple Music and we listened to it...five times.  Then my son asked if I would make a play along of this song...so I did.

This is not the easiest song.  Raised up from the original Key of Bb, and slowed down to about 80% of the original key.

This is an edited video...I had originally forgot to add the list of chords in the song.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

There is a key change in the middle that is an E Major Scale...an E Major Scale can be played instead of stopping and waiting for the new key.
