        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  The original is in D, so this is lowered by a whole step.  This uses four standard chords taught in most elementary ukulele methods!  (Am, F, G, C)

As seen in “The Greatest Showman.”  Go see it, and buy the DVD/Digital Version when it comes out!

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  Raised a whole step from the original (Key of Bb).

From “The Greatest Showman”

My wife and I finally had the chance to see this a couple of weeks ago (bringing our boys) and we both loved the show.  This duet works very well on the ukulele and in this key, isn’t so hard.  In the areas with C and Csus4, you can also throw in some Cadd9 chords (0203) but the C to Csus4 is easy to do and sounds good.
