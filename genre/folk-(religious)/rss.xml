        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Kids-Songs.TV.  It is nearly impossible to find a version of this song in C that uses only 3 chords and stays in C!  This is a transposed (from D) and shortened version of the original video.

Original video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giiK_lYsR0Q

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com. The colored font matches Aquila KIDS ukulele strings.]]></description>
