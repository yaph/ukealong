        <h2><a href="/song/johnny-cash-and-the-tennessee-two-folsom-prison-blues/">Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two - Folsom Prison Blues</a></h2>
        <p>June 06, 2017</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Folsom Prison Blues by Johnny Cash.  Key of F (F, F7, Bb, C7).

Whenever I attend a ukulele jam, this song is requested.  This is the original key (lowered slightly in pitch to match A=440)...I will be making a version in a higher key to match the chords in Jim Beloff's The Daily Ukulele.  I am attempting to make play alongs for songs that are fun to play, and for those that are commonly requested at ukulele jams, so that young/new players can feel at home in those jam sessions, being familiar with the "genre" of "popular" ukulele songs.

All rights remain with the music company who holds Johnny Cash's work; any advertisements that appear are for that company--not for this channel.

The ukulele font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com

Created using Keynote (layout, text, & lyrics) Keepvid.com (saving the original YouTube video), Audacity (ripping audio and modifying audio), Preview (working with the transparent "bouncing ball train"), and iMovie (placing the "bouncing ball train" and other edits.</p>
