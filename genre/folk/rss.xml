Chords Used: C, Gsus4, G7, F, D7, Ab, C7

As performed by The Ka'au Crater Boys.

This song has become a part of the traditional ukulele repertoire as a solo (you can find versions on the web if you would like to learn it), but in this case, you will be acting as the "rhythm section" underneath the solo.

I did not create a tutorial for this video, and you can play any strumming pattern that goes along with the rhythm section.
