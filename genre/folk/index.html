As performed by the Barenaked Ladies.

The first video play along I created was published on February 15, 2017 was "If I Had a Million Dollars."  https://youtu.be/HgiIcjZWGhw.  Over the last two years, I have created over 350 play along files (and well over 600 videos).  While this song isn't my favorite song, I liked it, and since I have changed how I make videos over these past two years (originally on my Mac, then on my iPad) I wanted to re-make that first video.  I also created a version in the original key (a little tricky for ukulele) and Baritone version as well.

Recently the Barenaked Ladies performed with Melanie Doane and her ukulele program in Toronto, which adds another ukulele to this song (not directly, but with the group).  https://youtu.be/rsmnykNk-4I

        <p>December 27, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of A.

As performed by Caspar Babypants (Chris Ballew), used with permission!  (Thanks, Caspar Babypants!)

The image for the video comes from the Kala Brand Instruments website (Kala Ukuleles).

On babypantsmusic.com, Caspar Babypants describes the inspiration for this song:

"I was watching a documentary about George Harrison and in that documentary Tom Petty told a story about George coming to his house to give him a ukulele. George and Tom strolled through the garden playing ukuleles having a grand old time. When George went to leave he asked Tom if he wanted more ukuleles. Tom said he was okay with one ukulele but George insisted and opened the trunk of his car to reveal a HUGE pile of ukuleles. The moment Tom Petty finished telling the story I realized I had to write a song about this incredible moment. I think it's good advice to always keep a ukulele within arms reach! You never know when you need to elevate your mood with the sparkly sound of a uke."

I really like this song for a number of reasons.  First, it pays tribute to George Harrison, one of the Beatles.  The song also pays tribute in its actual sound, which is reminiscent (to me) to "Yellow Submarine."  Second, the song is about ukuleles.  Finally, the song offers some opportunities to stretch your playing ability with some more difficult chords (C#min, F#7) and some fingerpicking.

        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Em.

As performed by The Kiboomers.

When I was in elementary school, we had a music teacher who would sing (and play) this song with us.  The song goes back to 1893 (by Harry S. Miller), and is the story about a man who tries to get rid of a pesky cat, but the cat keeps coming back (and those who try to get rid of the cat usually perish).  It’s an eerie song—but it is a song I have always liked and it brings back happy childhood memories.  This version by the Kiboomers isn’t as dark as some other versions out there.

I am aware that the song talks about a “yellow cat,” but the image of the cat that I found was too cute to not use.

My wife and I had the chance to travel to Memphis, Tennessee this past week (July 2018) on a short vacation with the side goal of joining the Memphis Ukulele Flash Mob at their weekly meeting at Central BBQ, led by Pete McCarty.  It was wonderful all the way around...friendly people, great food, and fun music making.  Pete picked a number of Memphis-related music because we were there, including this song, Jug Band Music (Seems So Sweet).  I didn’t know the song, so I share this version by Lucinda Williams with you, as MUFM shared it with my wife and I.  Are you in Memphis or passing through on a Tuesday night?  I urge you to stop on by...but get there early to order food and to get a chair!

I wanted to make a play along for “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,” and this version was straightforward—but has two other traditional Irish songs.  And thus a medley play along.  I considered shortening the song—but the keys are straightforward and the hardest chord is a diminished chord.

        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F and F minor.

As performed by Burl Ives.

Have you ever stopped to wonder why so many of our childhood songs are so dark?  Remember...”Ring Around The Rosy” is supposedly about the Black Plague.

I have been looking for more songs to do, and I want to make sure that we are providing content for beginner players, too.  The directory has a lot of one, two, three, and four chord songs.  But I know there are songs that are missing, so I looked in the table of contents for a ukulele method book, and this song is one of the early songs in that book.

Getting past the depressing lyrics (If Aunt Rhody only cared about the goose for a feather bed, she can still do that, can’t she?), the song is strong from a musical perspective—with two chords in a verse, and switching to minor.  You do need to be able to play f minor—but this song would be an effective way to learn.  It is also a little haunting to hear Burl Ives sing in a minor key—creepy.  Apparently “Resident Evil” used this song as well...so if you use this songs with students, prepare to creep them out.

I’m not going to lie...this was a favorite song of mine growing up...and thus my decision to make it a play along.  In G, the hardest chord is Bm (barre chord).  I just read that the makers of Trolls bought the rights to the Puff franchise...so perhaps there will be a new movie about Puff as well as a Justin Timberlake version of this song!

        <p>June 05, 2017</p>
        <p>For educational purposes.  The Brothers Four version of Beautiful Brown Eyes transposed to the Key of D (D, G, E7, A7).  You can leave the E7 out, but the Brothers Four definitely sing an E7 in harmony on each chorus.

The intent of this ukulele play along is to provide songs that are frequently performed at ukulele jam sessions from all age groups.

The original YouTube video of this song (in its original key) can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SthMCp539j0

        <p>June 03, 2017</p>
        <p>A Ukulele Play Along version of This Land Is Your Land in the Key of C (F, C, G7).  Song by Woody Guthrie, performance by Elizabeth Mitchell.   For educational purposes.  Audio edited to just include a few verses from this lyric video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRnHx3yVuf4.

Many of the ukulele play alongs are created with pop music to keep students engaged.  I am 100% behind that effort--however, I am trying to bring songs that are often used at ukulele jam sessions to this format as well, so that all players can become material with some of the more common "ukulele songs" and sing and play together.

        <h2><a href="/song/slim-dusty-waltzing-matilda/">Slim Dusty - Waltzing Matilda (1996 Digital Remaster)</a></h2>
        <p>June 02, 2017</p>
        <p>A ukulele play along of "Waltzing Matilda" in the key of C: C, G7, Am, F.

I chose to make this song into a play along as it is commonly requested at a local jam session.  While I want to continue to prepare pop tunes for students, I also want them to learn some of the folk tradition and common literature played in ukulele groups.

For this song, I used the audio track by Slim Dusty from this lyric YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2DSil5RriU

I had to lower the audio by a whole step to get into the Key of C (I also had to raise the pitch a bit to get it in tune with A440).

I didn't want to use the original video as the text was impossible to read and the words didn't match the singer's words.

As there are a number of Australian terms in the song, I also included the information about the song from Rolf Harris on this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEVKUE_ma00
