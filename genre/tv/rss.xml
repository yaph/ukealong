        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com//song/gilligans-island-ukulele-play-along-tv-show-video-background/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.

Here’s a lesson on barre chords, using the theme to Gilligan’s Island.  A lot of people may not know this show, but as I grew up, this show was one of the shows in syndication—and I watched it every afternoon.  Here’s a great way to learn some barre chords (only two shapes, the “Am” and the “A” shapes).  The second half of the song (ending credits) moves quite a bit faster.  Don’t forget that you can use YouTube’s tools to slow down a video and retain the pitch.
