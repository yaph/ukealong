        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/jack-stauber-buttercup/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[Buttercup by Jack Stauber, with lyrics.  Chords used: Gmaj7 & F sharp minor.  For educational use.  The chords for the intro and outro have been intentionally omitted to make it easier to play.  The Gmaj7 could be replaced with a regular G chord.  The F sharp minor chord is the same shape as a G7, just played on strings 2, 3, and 4.
