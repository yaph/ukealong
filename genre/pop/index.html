Rock Cowles of The Spartanburg Ukulele Club posted a song sheet of this song on March 23, 2019, and I thought it would make a great play along.  I do use some different chords than the Spartanburg chord sheet.  I have created six versions of this play along...full versions for CGEA, DGBE, and Lyrics only (chords above), as well as a modified version that will be better for schools.  The full version is blocked in some countries, the modified version is not.  A YouTube search should bring up all versions of the song, or you could visit ukestuff.info and access the full listing of songs with clickable links (updated monthly).

        <p>February 09, 2019</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  Raised a half step from the original (Key of F#).

As performed by Miley Cyrus.

A little bit about this song...I have been unable to find songs that I want to make play alongs out of, and much of the current Top 40 (that we haven't already made play along videos for) have explicit lyrics.  Most of the play along videos I create are intended to be able to used in a classroom, and lyrics are a concern.

So I looked at several lists of "Top 100 Pop Songs of All Time" and this song appeared, so I decided to start it, in the Key of G.  As I was wrapping up the first version of the video, I decided to look to see if it had been done already...and it had--very well--by my colleague Andy Ramos (https://youtu.be/TMyrB8iVlOY).  I don't usually re-make videos unless I have another specific goal, so this was a mistake.  Since there isn't a Baritone version, I modified the video for Baritone, and then changed the Key to the Key of F as well (a half step lower than the original).  I noticed that, in F, most of the song, other than the bridge, uses four basic chords (F, Am, Dm, C), so I decided to also add a version that removed the bridge...making the song easier to play than the Key of G on GCEA ukulele (i.e. Bm barre chord).  So in the end, I'm glad I made the song...but didn't mean to copy Andy's work in any way.

I don't usually re-make videos unless I have another specific goal, so this was a mistake.  Since there isn't a Baritone version, I modified the video for Baritone, and then changed the Key to the Key of F as well (a half step lower than the original).  I noticed that, in F, most of the song, other than the bridge, uses four basic chords (F, Am, Dm, C), so I decided to also add a version that removed the bridge...making the song easier to play than the Key of G on GCEA ukulele (i.e. Bm barre chord).  So in the end, I'm glad I made the song...but didn't mean to copy Andy's work in any way.

I was playing some tab music tonight on ukulele and cam across Ukulenny’s Wipeout (http://www.ukulenny.com).  I realized that I had not made a play along of Wipeout, not had anyone else.

As performed by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.

I heard this a couple of days ago at a St. Paul Saints (independent league) baseball game, and thought about making this play along again.  I had tried in the past, but gave up—it is really hard to get the chords to sound right.  This is my best shot..and I think it works.  There is a quick chord change in the verse...but practice it and you’ll get it.  As mentioned previously, I have lowered the key to Am, and taken away the modulation that happens in the bridge.  Enjoy!

Surfin' USA - The Beach Boys

This is one of the first songs we learn and the ukuleles in the video match the colour of the chords we use (Rainbow method).

We have been using the original version of this video by Dr Jill Reese which has really helped us, it's just been tweaked a little to match our chord colours.

As performed by The Young Rascals.

I heard this song on the radio the other day, and thought it would be fun as a play along.  It is...but the chords in D didn’t sound right (different inversions than the original).  The chords move fast, and it was tough to get all of the changes in.  Think you can play C, F, and G?  Here’s your real world authentic test (Yes, there is a D or two...but there is no speed needed to play it).

        <p>April 21, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  Lowered a half step from the original key.

As performed by Rick Astley.

This song suddenly appeared on the ukutabs top daily request list, so I decided to put it to a video play along format.  The song is pretty famous for its life after its initial popularity, where people would be taken from a website to this song, as a practical joke (Rick-Rolled).  Online chord charts show the use of a FMaj7...which isn’t a very friendly ukulele chord.  All of the notes of F appear in a FMaj7, so I have just left the chords as plain F, G, Em, and Am chords.  I think it works as it is.

I had made a version of the original Wham! recording, but it was blocked in many countries.  This version seems to be used for lyric videos, so hopefully it will be accessible.  It is a very good cover of the original.

As performed by Karsten Troyke & Suzanna as found at https://youtu.be/H6uBysoQkDw

Someone on Ukulele Underground requested the chords for this song, which brought it to my attention.  This is a wonderful folk song in Am.

Translation in English (in Yiddish):

A young lad is thinking, thinking all night
Would it be wrong, he asks, or maybe right,
Should he declare his love, dare he choose,
And would she accept, or will she refuse?

Chorus:
Tumbala, tumbala, tumbalalaika,
Tumbala, tumbala, tumbalalaika
tumbalalaika, play Balalaika,
tumbalalaika - let us be merry.

Maiden, maiden tell me again
What can grow, grow without rain,
What can burn for many years,
What can long and cry without tears?


Silly young lad, why ask again?
It's a stone that can grow, grow without rain,
It's love that can burn for many long years,
A the heart that can yearn and cry without tears.

As performed by Naill Horan.

I really wanted to bring this song to you in the original key, but there was a need to switch from F#m to E...which just isn’t GCEA ukulele friendly.  Therefore, I modified this for the key of G.  Try playing this by alternatively plucking the 3rd string (C string) and the 2nd and 1st strings (E and A strings) at the same time.

My boys enjoyed Sing and frequently sing this song.  I had started working on but moved on to other videos.  Katie Denure (One Music School) posted a tutorial today (https://youtu.be/m_Xoe9g00oc), which inspired me to wrap up this video.  I took away some of the fast Ab Bb C changes that occur at the end of some phrases...feel free to add them back in your own practice.  This video offers some good Barre chord practice (partial and full) with Cm, Ab, and Bb.

What an absolutely gorgeous song.  The bridge is stunning, and the ending going from dim7 to tonic is outstanding.  And it works well with the ukulele.  I may try placing this in G, which would be even easier to play on the ukulele—not sure how it will sound in that key (transposed up two whole steps).  The tricky chords are the Bb and the Bbm, and as things go, those aren’t too bad.

As performed by Meghan Trainor.  Most of the chord charts of this song show standard chords...but it doesn’t take long to play with the recording to realize that Meghan Trainor uses some modified (but not overly difficult) chords instead of 1st position chords on the ukulele.  This play along attempts to follow her chords as much as possible. Look for an added note (1st string, 3rd fret) through much of the song.  And in the final progressions, Play Fm to C by leaving C with your 4th finger (pinky).  This should be a nice song to challenge players who are ready to start playing beyond 1st position.  Enjoy!

As performed by Ed Sheeran.

I’ll be honest...this one was tricky. In looking up the chords, a lot of sites have this in D.  That is great...because with a four chord song, I can drop it a whole step and make it beginner friendly with C, Am, F, and G...the “Color Chords (see Kala’s new ukulele).”  Well, I lowered the pitch and things weren’t right...the intro tab had sharps (in C?) and I quickly realized that several sites had ALREADY lowered the pitch for ukulele.  The song was originally in E.  Why E?  It is a great, rich key on the guitar (lots of open strings) and some voices (like Sheeran’s) fit well in the key.  So...I could have gone with D (D, Bm, G, A) or F...but D is a whole step transition, so I went UP the half step to F (F, Dm, Bb, C). I think that’s the right choice, unless you want to play in Sheeran’s original key playing in D (with a Bm barre chord) and using a capo on the 2nd Fret.

Check the lyrics as this may not be appropriate for use in a school setting (i.e. “do what the bunnies do,” and “spoon.”).

This version Includes some of the color chords (Fadd9) that Ingrid uses but are not on the chord charts you will find on the internet.  For the Gsus4, play a G chord and add the pinky at the same time.

The original leads to a final chorus that is not accompanied by ukulele.  I ended the play along at that point.  Sorry about the chords there..Ingrid switches to Csus4 to C to Csus4 to C at the end and I didn’t want to add yet another slide.

I was looking for a version of this song that better worked when transposed to C (The original Key of the best known version is F), but I couldn’t find one;  this version, however, is in G, and is easier for beginners to play than F (Which uses a barre chord or partial barre chord Bb).

I'll be honest..this was a fun one to work on.  It is shifted up a whole step from the original recording.   None of the online lead sheets matched what I was hearing..and I tried to incorporate some of the passing tones with chords like Cmaj7.  In this key, the song is pretty straightforward and fun to play.  Listen to the song for strumming pattern ideas (e.g. single strums at the beginning).

This video is unique as it was created 100% on my iPad Pro, using the LumaFusion editing app (and Pixelmator to make some transparent PNGs, Dropbox, and AnyFont--as well as Chordette for Education for ukulele chord fonts--available at ukefarm.com).

One note...during the longer instrumental break, I have the chords switching from F to G.  You could make the case that it should be Dm to G, which is a difference of one note on the ukulele.  However, the whole break is an extension of the previously sung lyrics over F and G...and in the interest of keeping 4 chords (no G7!), I went with F to G.</p>

        <p>June 13, 2017</p>
        <p>For Educational Use.  Under the Boardwalk by the Drifters.  In the original Key of G (G, Hawaiian D7, C, Em, G7, and D).  The famous Yellow Book ("The Daily Ukulele")  features this song in C.

This song has some significance in the ukulele world, as it is a common song at jam sessions, and is also the anthem of the Ukulele Club of Santa Cruz, and there is a documentary of that club called, "Under the Boardwalk: A Ukulele Love Story."

The original video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRQm7Yt77k0

        <p>June 12, 2017</p>
        <p>For Educational Use.  26 Miles (Santa Catalina) by the Four Preps.  In the Key of C: C, Am, F, G7, Dm, C7, Hawaiian D7, G.

I have been making ukulele video play alongs, and this song is a common request at ukulele jam sessions.  Featured prominently in the song is the standard four chord progression.

As a note, the original recording (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dPaeUGrmdA) seems to be in C#...I don't know why they would have sung it in that key--even with Guitars--so I have dropped the pitch one half step to be in the Key of C.

        <p>June 05, 2017</p>
        <p>For educational purposes--all rights remain with the group.

"Crazy" by Burn the Ballroom.  In the Key of F (F, A, Dm, Bb, Bbm, C, C7).  I heard this song as bumper music on the Tony Kornheiser Show--and it stick in my head as a great song for a ukulele play along.  The lyrics may not be appropriate for young students.  The melody is wonderful!

This song was fun to work out, as the chords were not readily available on various "tab" websites.

The group's albums and this song can be found on iTunes and Amazon.   You can also access the group's YouTube recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrSlr2LxdDk

        <p>Ukulele play along of Stitches by Shawn Mendes - Am G C F (original song transposed down half step to fit ukulele)

The part just before the chorus has slightly different chords... watch the video carefully!
Can be played with D-U-U-U-U strumming or following the finger picking guide. This is a decent song for beginners to practice figuring out tab and finger picking, but speed is the main issue.
