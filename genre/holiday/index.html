        <h2><a href="/song/anne-janelle-angels-we-have-heard-on-high/">Anne Janelle - Angels We Have Heard on High</a></h2>
        <p>December 25, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  A new melody to the traditional Christmas Carol (and a new verse).
Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of B-flat.  Think it is an unfriendly key?  I also transposed the song to C, making it far easier to play (https://youtu.be/gxAvBJza7iM).

As performed by Anne Janelle with James Hill.  Anne Janelle is a singer and cello player, and is married to ukulele virtuoso and ukulele educator James Hill.  Anne released this song this week--and released a handwritten chart of the chords of the song today, inviting people to play along.  As it is Christmas Day, this will be the last Christmas/holiday play along that I create in 2018.

If you are new to the channel and/or ukulele, you can find all kinds of play along videos like these, which allow you to play along with the music you already know and love--sometimes modified to be in more ukulele friendly keys.  There are also a number of great ukulele instructors on YouTube, including Cynthia Lin, Kate DeNure (One Music School), John Atkins (The Ukulele Teacher), Mike Lynch (who passed away in January of 2018, but his many videos are still out there to learn from), Stu Fuchs, Aldrine Guerrero (Ukulele Underground) and more.

        <p>June 28, 2017</p>
        <p>For Educational Use.  Best with GCEA tuned ukuleles (due to embedded chord charts). Key of C.  The second part of the melody has a fast chord progression...it is suggested that you practice it separately.

The original version was in C# (!), so the audio has been lowered a half step.  The full version has a quick modulation to G, and a couple of verses that refer to Christianity.  For the sake of public schools, these have been removed in a shortened version (link: https://youtu.be/V0rESDdlBIw)
