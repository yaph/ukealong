        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  (Raised 80 cents from the original audio).

As performed by Bryant Oden.  Used with permission!  See his work at songdrops.com, and also subscribe to his YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/songdrops).

My local ukulele group had a Halloween-themed play along yesterday, and someone had this song.  I knew I had to make it into a Play Along.  Watch for some other play alongs from SongDrops in the future.
