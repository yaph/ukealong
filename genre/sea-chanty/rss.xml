        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  Lowered one step from the original in D.

As performed by The Irish Rovers.

I don’t know if you can do this song at schools any more...but it remains a great tune (sea chanty) and is a great way to introduce Dm.  The original went from Em to D...but I wanted to build off of C for this video.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
