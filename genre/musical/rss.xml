        <link><![CDATA[http://localhost:8080/song/demi-lovato-let-it-go/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G (Original Key)

As performed by Demi Lovato.

I also created a play along of “Let It Go” from the movie Frozen, but there are a few more twists and turns harmonically in that version (https://youtu.be/FyyWuj-jS1U).

There is one part of a verse in this version where a Dm and Cm are substituted for D and C...that’s kind of fun...watch for it.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of D and F...18 chords in all!  I was originally considering changing the key...but the original key is about as ukulele friendly as you are going to find, even with some expanded chords.  I think these chords work better than most of the written chord charts you will find for this song on the Internet.  Enjoy!

As performed in Aladdin!

        <link><![CDATA[http://localhost:8080/song/na-can-you-feel-the-love---instrumental/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  The original (by Elton John—not the version in the movie) is in Bb, so this version is raised a whole step.  This is a great song to introduce Bb (if you know the other chords), as the chord changes are nice and slow and a single strum per beat works very well with the song.

As performed by Elton John.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  Lowered one half step from the original key.

As performed by Idina Menzel in “Frozen”

The introduction to this song is tricky with some Am sus4, Am, and A chords that are not typical...however, they sounded better where written.  If these are too difficult, I plan to put Demi Lovato’s version of “Let It Go” into a ukulele play along soon, and that uses less complicated chords.  Once you get past the intro, chords are pretty standard, but there are some Bm and Bb chords, and a solitary C chord.
