        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.

As performed by Karsten Troyke & Suzanna as found at https://youtu.be/H6uBysoQkDw

Someone on Ukulele Underground requested the chords for this song, which brought it to my attention.  This is a wonderful folk song in Am.

Translation in English (in Yiddish):

A young lad is thinking, thinking all night
Would it be wrong, he asks, or maybe right,
Should he declare his love, dare he choose,
And would she accept, or will she refuse?

Chorus:
Tumbala, tumbala, tumbalalaika,
Tumbala, tumbala, tumbalalaika
tumbalalaika, play Balalaika,
tumbalalaika - let us be merry.

Maiden, maiden tell me again
What can grow, grow without rain,
What can burn for many years,
What can long and cry without tears?


Silly young lad, why ask again?
It's a stone that can grow, grow without rain,
It's love that can burn for many long years,
A the heart that can yearn and cry without tears.

        <title><![CDATA[Tiny Tim - Tip Toe Thru' the Tulips with Me - Key of C]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://ukealong.com/song/tiny-tim-tip-toe-thru-the-tulips-with-me/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Optimized for GCEA Ukulele.  Key of C.

In my opinion, two things led to the decline of the ukulele in the late 1960s (continuing until the early 2000s).  The first was the emergence of guitar-based rock (and people wanting to be rock stars), and the image of Tiny Tim.  As part of his "gimmick," Tiny Tim played the ukulele and sang in a weird falsetto, causing an entire generation to associate the ukulele with being a weirdo and maybe even a freak.  When you look deeper at Tiny Tim, he was an accomplished musician but he also knew how to make his mark using a gimmick.

See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMbQsKJ64S0

A number of factors led to the re-emergence of the ukulele in the early 2000s, but even today some people have the mental image of Tiny Tim when they think of the ukulele.  I even had a teacher come up to me at a convention and start singing, "Tiptoe Through the Tulips."

You know what?  We cannot escape the history of this instrument, and Tiny Tim had an impact on it.  That should be acknowledged.  It should also be noted that his signature song, "Tiptoe Through the Tulips," existed long before he used it--written in 1929.

Now, about this rendition...I have modified Tiny Tim's recording down a major 3rd so it matches common chord progressions.  He plays it in E, but may be using a ukulele that is tuned A D F# B, which would essentially make the song like playing in D on a GCEA ukulele.

Usually, changing the pitch of a song more than a second makes the audio unrecognizable--in this case, as Tiny Tim uses his falsetto, it isn't as noticeable.  If you want to play along with Tiny Tim's recording at pitch, use a Capo at the 4th fret and use these chords, or tune your ukulele to ADF#B and play it in D (C becomes D, etc.).

        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Key of F: F & C7.  The second verse was written by Jim Beloff (author of many ukulele songbooks, including The Daily Ukulele).  The original is in C...I chose to sing this recording in F, as the version in C is too low for my tenor voice.

        <description><![CDATA[For Educational Use.  Key of C: C & G7.  The second verse was written by Jim Beloff (author of many ukulele songbooks, including The Daily Ukulele).  This version is really too low for my voice as a tenor, and thus I did record a version in F, which should be just as easy for beginners to play.
