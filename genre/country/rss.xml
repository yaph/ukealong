        <description><![CDATA[Chords: F, B-flat, C, Gm (similar to F...just moved over and with the 3rd finger)
Strum Patterns (per chord picture)?...D-D-D-DU (quick shuffle rhythm) or D-  --  D- DU ....you can do the first pattern during the rockin' refrain and the second pattern during the thoughtful/peaceful verses.  Just an idea...whatever works for you is what works for you. Keep strummin'!]]></description>
