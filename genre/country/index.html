Note: The D chord is actually D/A but as the nice people at the ukulele-chords.com let us know: "Altered bass note is already part of the un-slashed chord, it does not make sense to play it on a ukulele."

Also Cmaj7 can be played as a regular C but the former is the one JC uses.</p>

        <p>Knee Deep" by Zac Brown Band featuring Jimmy Buffet
I transposed the song down to the key of D to make it more friendly for the ukulele.

This video features:
--demonstration of the "hammer-on" technique
--a hammer-on pattern to play throughout the song
--a strumming pattern for chords that can be played throughout the song
--you may choose to switch back and forth between playing the hammer-on pattern and chords. (The play-along screen is split so you see both the hammer pattern and the chords.)

A fun song for summer!
