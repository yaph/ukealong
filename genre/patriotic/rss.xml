Chords Used: C, F

Born in the USA by Bruce Springsteen.  It’s been digitally raised by 1 semitone so beginner ukulele students can play along.   The chords have been added to a lyric video by YouTuber TheFreak093, which may be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3lmb... .  If I were teaching this I would be tempted to turn off the projector and work with counting 16 beats of each chord (changing ever 16 beats from C to F).

The US Navy Song.  It's just the chorus, and it's been digitally altered to lower the pitch 3 semitones so beginner ukulele player can learn the song.  There are chords, the melody line, lyrics, and ukulele tab.


I recommend using https://youloop.io/ to slow it down and isolate phrases / measures to work on.
