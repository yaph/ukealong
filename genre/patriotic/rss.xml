Chords Used: C, F

Born in the USA by Bruce Springsteen.  It’s been digitally raised by 1 semitone so beginner ukulele students can play along.   The chords have been added to a lyric video by YouTuber TheFreak093, which may be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3lmb... .  If I were teaching this I would be tempted to turn off the projector and work with counting 16 beats of each chord (changing ever 16 beats from C to F).

The US Navy Song.  It's just the chorus, and it's been digitally altered to lower the pitch 3 semitones so beginner ukulele player can learn the song.  There are chords, the melody line, lyrics, and ukulele tab.


I recommend using https://youloop.io/ to slow it down and isolate phrases / measures to work on.

The first verse and refrain of the US Army's Song, The Army Goes Marching Along.  It is also known as the US Army Anthem, and as The Caissons Go Rolling Along.  There are chords, the melody line, lyrics, and ukulele tab.  The pitch has been raised one whole step (from Bb to C) to make the melody work on uke.  The many passing chords playing by the band have been simplified for this play along.

I recommend using https://youloop.io/ to slow it down and isolate phrases / measures to work on.
