        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Chords Used: G D Em C B7 Am F

Spirit (from Disney’s The Lion King) by Beyoncé.  It’s been raised by 2 semitones and the modulation has been removed so beginner ukulele students can play along.  Also, the “quick change” chords have not been included.  As for the B7 chord, feel free to do it 432X instead of using the barre.

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of D.  This is the original key.  If the Bm barre chord is too difficult, there is a version of this video that is transposed to the Key of C.

As performed by Carl Douglas.

I was on a road trip this week, and a guy had a shirt that read, “What if everybody wasn’t Kung Fu fighting?”  Obviously, I instantly had my next play along video in mind.
