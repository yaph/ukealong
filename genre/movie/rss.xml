Using the chords: A  Am  B7  Cmaj7  Em

Suggested Strum Pattern:  D D D DU or single strums
You can be quite flexible with the strumming as it is slow

If you prefer, try playing some of the Am and Cmaj7 chords with your 1st finger to make it easier to move to the Em and B7 chords

Spirit (from Disney’s The Lion King) by Beyoncé.  It’s been raised by 2 semitones and the modulation has been removed so beginner ukulele students can play along.  Also, the “quick change” chords have not been included.  As for the B7 chord, feel free to do it 432X instead of using the barre.
