Spirit (from Disney’s The Lion King) by Beyoncé.  It’s been raised by 2 semitones and the modulation has been removed so beginner ukulele students can play along.  Also, the “quick change” chords have not been included.  As for the B7 chord, feel free to do it 432X instead of using the barre.

As performed by Carl Douglas.

I was on a road trip this week, and a guy had a shirt that read, “What if everybody wasn’t Kung Fu fighting?”  Obviously, I instantly had my next play along video in mind.

        <p>June 13, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  Lowered a minor third from the original.

As performed by Randy Newman.

I have wanted to arrange this for some time.  Another video play along showed chords that didn’t match the music (!).  Randy Newman is incredible, and the original chords are tough on ukulele.  I lowered the key to make it work better for ukulele, and there are some chords that I chose that work—but are definitely not the original chord (D#dim and Dm in the intro).  That said, these chords work with the recording—and could be taken away from the recording and performed live.  I might make a chord sheet for this one.

Dedicated to my friend and college roommate, David, who loved Toy Story.  Incidentally, one of my sons is named Andy and had both Woody and Buzz (we didn’t name him after Toy Story...going for the full name “Andrew”)
