    <title itemprop="name">Kiboomu Kids Songs - The Cat Came Back (2014 Version)</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Em.

As performed by The Kiboomers.

When I was in elementary school, we had a music teacher who would sing (and play) this song with us.  The song goes back to 1893 (by Harry S. Miller), and is the story about a man who tries to get rid of a pesky cat, but the cat keeps coming back (and those who try to get rid of the cat usually perish).  It’s an eerie song—but it is a song I have always liked and it brings back happy childhood memories.  This version by the Kiboomers isn’t as dark as some other versions out there.

I am aware that the song talks about a “yellow cat,” but the image of the cat that I found was too cute to not use.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
