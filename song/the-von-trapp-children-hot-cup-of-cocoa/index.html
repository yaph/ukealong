    <title itemprop="name">The Von Trapp Children - Hot Cup Of Cocoa</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of D.  Lowered from the original and kept in one key (The original is in Eb and E).  In the intro area, I did not add the suspensions on the D and A7--feel free to add them as you play (if you wish).

As performed by the Von Trapp Children.

This was a request from Marsha Burton Joss on the Facebook Ukulele Video Play Along Group.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
