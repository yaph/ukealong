    <title itemprop="name">Gene Autry - Here Comes Santa Claus (Down Santa Claus Lane) (78rpm Version)</title>
<meta name="description" content="For Educational Use.  Best with GCEA tuned ukuleles (due to embedded chord charts). Key of C.  The second part of the melody has a fast chord progression...it is suggested that you practice it separately.

The original version was in C# (!), so the audio has been lowered a half step.  The full version has a quick modulation to G, and a couple of verses that refer to Christianity.  For the sake of public schools, these have been removed in a shortened version (link: https://youtu.be/V0rESDdlBIw)

Created on an iPad with Luma Fusion, iCab Mobile. Twisted Wave, and Any Font.  The ukulele chord font is a part of Chordette for Education which can be found at ukefarm.com"><meta name="author" content="Author Name">
