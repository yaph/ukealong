    <title itemprop="name">Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell - Ain't No Mountain High Enough (The Motown Story: The 60s Version)</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  I have altered the key from the original by a whole step (lower) and minor third (removing a modulation in the song).

As performed by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.

I heard this a couple of days ago at a St. Paul Saints (independent league) baseball game, and thought about making this play along again.  I had tried in the past, but gave up—it is really hard to get the chords to sound right.  This is my best shot..and I think it works.  There is a quick chord change in the verse...but practice it and you’ll get it.  As mentioned previously, I have lowered the key to Am, and taken away the modulation that happens in the bridge.  Enjoy!

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
