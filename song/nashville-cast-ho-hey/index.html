    <title itemprop="name">Nashville Cast - Ho Hey</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  Lowered from the original key of C#.

As performed by Lennon and Maisy Stella.

Many thanks to Katie Wardrobe (midnightmusic.com.au) for suggesting this song!

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS and DR Multi-Color ukulele strings.

This version matches the educational Color Chord approach and uses four chords: C (red sticker), G (green stickers), F (yellow stickers) and Am (blue sticker).

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
