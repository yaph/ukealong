    <title itemprop="name">Carl Douglas - Kung Fu Fighting</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  Transposed down from the original in D (also available as a play along video).

As performed by Carl Douglas.

I was on a road trip this week, and a guy had a shirt that read, “What if everybody wasn’t Kung Fu fighting?”  Obviously, I instantly had my next play along video in mind.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
