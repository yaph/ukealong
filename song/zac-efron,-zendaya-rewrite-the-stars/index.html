    <title itemprop="name">Zac Efron, Zendaya - Rewrite The Stars</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  Raised a whole step from the original (Key of Bb).

From “The Greatest Showman”

My wife and I finally had the chance to see this a couple of weeks ago (bringing our boys) and we both loved the show.  This duet works very well on the ukulele and in this key, isn’t so hard.  In the areas with C and Csus4, you can also throw in some Cadd9 chords (0203) but the C to Csus4 is easy to do and sounds good.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
