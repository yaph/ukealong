As performed by Christina Perri

I'll be honest..this was a fun one to work on.  It is shifted up a whole step from the original recording.   None of the online lead sheets matched what I was hearing..and I tried to incorporate some of the passing tones with chords like Cmaj7.  In this key, the song is pretty straightforward and fun to play.  Listen to the song for strumming pattern ideas (e.g. single strums at the beginning).

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"
