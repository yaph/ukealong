    <title itemprop="name">OneRepublic - Rescue Me (Acoustic)</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  Lowered a whole step from the original key, because some people are really going to struggle with the Bm from the original key (that version is also available).  Side note: keep practicing and you'll master it!

Chords Used:  Am, G, C, F

As performed by OneRepublic.  This was a request from my own two boys, age 7 & 10.  If you read these comments, they would be thrilled if you watched some of their videos and followed them.
