    <title itemprop="name">Barenaked Ladies - If I Had $1,000,000</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of A.  Original Key.

As performed by the Barenaked Ladies.

The first video play along I created was published on February 15, 2017 was "If I Had a Million Dollars."  https://youtu.be/HgiIcjZWGhw.  Over the last two years, I have created over 350 play along files (and well over 600 videos).  While this song isn't my favorite song, I liked it, and since I have changed how I make videos over these past two years (originally on my Mac, then on my iPad) I wanted to re-make that first video.  I also created a version in the original key (a little tricky for ukulele) and Baritone version as well.

Recently the Barenaked Ladies performed with Melanie Doane and her ukulele program in Toronto, which adds another ukulele to this song (not directly, but with the group).  https://youtu.be/rsmnykNk-4I

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

There is a master list of all similar play along videos at my blog: ukestuff.info.  Access to the blog, and all materials on the blog is free.
