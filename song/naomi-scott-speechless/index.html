    <title itemprop="name">Naomi Scott - Speechless (Full) (From "Aladdin"/Soundtrack Version)</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for CGEA ukulele.  Key of Em.

Chords Used: Em, D7, C, D, G, Bsus4, B, Am, Bm7

Original performance by Naomi Scott, from the (2019) motion picture "Aladdin"

Earlier today, I had posted a version of this without the "follow the chord boxes."  I'm not quite sure where they went, as I start with the ukulele version and then move to other versions.  So, I have re-uploaded the video.  Sorry for any inconvenience.
