    <title itemprop="name">Imagine Dragons - Believer</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  The original is in A#m (not a great key for ukulele)...so if you want to play the original key, use a capo on the first fret and play these chords.  My boys (age 5 & 9) sing this song all the time (they hear it on the bus on the way to/from school), so I figured it needed to become a play along.  You can experiment with finger picking patterns to match the original guitar.

As performed by Imagine Dragons.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com."><meta name="author" content="Author Name">
