    <title itemprop="name">Chuck Berry - Johnny B. Goode (Alt. Take 2/3)</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

As performed by Chuck Berry, transposed up a whole step.  I had wanted to make this video play along video since hearing about Chuck Berry's passing in March of 2017.  So here it is four months later.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com."><meta name="author" content="Author Name">
