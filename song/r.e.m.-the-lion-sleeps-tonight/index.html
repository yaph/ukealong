    <title itemprop="name">R.E.M. - The Lion Sleeps Tonight</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.

As performed by REM.

I was looking for a version of this song that better worked when transposed to C (The original Key of the best known version is F), but I couldn’t find one;  this version, however, is in G, and is easier for beginners to play than F (Which uses a barre chord or partial barre chord Bb).

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS ukulele strings."><meta name="author" content="Author Name">
