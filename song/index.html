Rock Cowles of The Spartanburg Ukulele Club posted a song sheet of this song on March 23, 2019, and I thought it would make a great play along.  I do use some different chords than the Spartanburg chord sheet.  I have created six versions of this play along...full versions for CGEA, DGBE, and Lyrics only (chords above), as well as a modified version that will be better for schools.  The full version is blocked in some countries, the modified version is not.  A YouTube search should bring up all versions of the song, or you could visit ukestuff.info and access the full listing of songs with clickable links (updated monthly).

        <p>February 26, 2019</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of A.  Original Key.

As performed by the Barenaked Ladies.

The first video play along I created was published on February 15, 2017 was "If I Had a Million Dollars."  https://youtu.be/HgiIcjZWGhw.  Over the last two years, I have created over 350 play along files (and well over 600 videos).  While this song isn't my favorite song, I liked it, and since I have changed how I make videos over these past two years (originally on my Mac, then on my iPad) I wanted to re-make that first video.  I also created a version in the original key (a little tricky for ukulele) and Baritone version as well.

Recently the Barenaked Ladies performed with Melanie Doane and her ukulele program in Toronto, which adds another ukulele to this song (not directly, but with the group).  https://youtu.be/rsmnykNk-4I

        <p>February 09, 2019</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  Raised a half step from the original (Key of F#).

As performed by Miley Cyrus.

A little bit about this song...I have been unable to find songs that I want to make play alongs out of, and much of the current Top 40 (that we haven't already made play along videos for) have explicit lyrics.  Most of the play along videos I create are intended to be able to used in a classroom, and lyrics are a concern.

So I looked at several lists of "Top 100 Pop Songs of All Time" and this song appeared, so I decided to start it, in the Key of G.  As I was wrapping up the first version of the video, I decided to look to see if it had been done already...and it had--very well--by my colleague Andy Ramos (https://youtu.be/TMyrB8iVlOY).  I don't usually re-make videos unless I have another specific goal, so this was a mistake.  Since there isn't a Baritone version, I modified the video for Baritone, and then changed the Key to the Key of F as well (a half step lower than the original).  I noticed that, in F, most of the song, other than the bridge, uses four basic chords (F, Am, Dm, C), so I decided to also add a version that removed the bridge...making the song easier to play than the Key of G on GCEA ukulele (i.e. Bm barre chord).  So in the end, I'm glad I made the song...but didn't mean to copy Andy's work in any way.

        <p>December 27, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of A.

As performed by Caspar Babypants (Chris Ballew), used with permission!  (Thanks, Caspar Babypants!)

The image for the video comes from the Kala Brand Instruments website (Kala Ukuleles).

On babypantsmusic.com, Caspar Babypants describes the inspiration for this song:

"I was watching a documentary about George Harrison and in that documentary Tom Petty told a story about George coming to his house to give him a ukulele. George and Tom strolled through the garden playing ukuleles having a grand old time. When George went to leave he asked Tom if he wanted more ukuleles. Tom said he was okay with one ukulele but George insisted and opened the trunk of his car to reveal a HUGE pile of ukuleles. The moment Tom Petty finished telling the story I realized I had to write a song about this incredible moment. I think it's good advice to always keep a ukulele within arms reach! You never know when you need to elevate your mood with the sparkly sound of a uke."

I really like this song for a number of reasons.  First, it pays tribute to George Harrison, one of the Beatles.  The song also pays tribute in its actual sound, which is reminiscent (to me) to "Yellow Submarine."  Second, the song is about ukuleles.  Finally, the song offers some opportunities to stretch your playing ability with some more difficult chords (C#min, F#7) and some fingerpicking.

        <p>December 25, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  A new melody to the traditional Christmas Carol (and a new verse).
Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of B-flat.  Think it is an unfriendly key?  I also transposed the song to C, making it far easier to play (https://youtu.be/gxAvBJza7iM).

As performed by Anne Janelle with James Hill.  Anne Janelle is a singer and cello player, and is married to ukulele virtuoso and ukulele educator James Hill.  Anne released this song this week--and released a handwritten chart of the chords of the song today, inviting people to play along.  As it is Christmas Day, this will be the last Christmas/holiday play along that I create in 2018.

If you are new to the channel and/or ukulele, you can find all kinds of play along videos like these, which allow you to play along with the music you already know and love--sometimes modified to be in more ukulele friendly keys.  There are also a number of great ukulele instructors on YouTube, including Cynthia Lin, Kate DeNure (One Music School), John Atkins (The Ukulele Teacher), Mike Lynch (who passed away in January of 2018, but his many videos are still out there to learn from), Stu Fuchs, Aldrine Guerrero (Ukulele Underground) and more.

        <p>July 26, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Em.

As performed by The Kiboomers.

When I was in elementary school, we had a music teacher who would sing (and play) this song with us.  The song goes back to 1893 (by Harry S. Miller), and is the story about a man who tries to get rid of a pesky cat, but the cat keeps coming back (and those who try to get rid of the cat usually perish).  It’s an eerie song—but it is a song I have always liked and it brings back happy childhood memories.  This version by the Kiboomers isn’t as dark as some other versions out there.

I am aware that the song talks about a “yellow cat,” but the image of the cat that I found was too cute to not use.

My wife and I had the chance to travel to Memphis, Tennessee this past week (July 2018) on a short vacation with the side goal of joining the Memphis Ukulele Flash Mob at their weekly meeting at Central BBQ, led by Pete McCarty.  It was wonderful all the way around...friendly people, great food, and fun music making.  Pete picked a number of Memphis-related music because we were there, including this song, Jug Band Music (Seems So Sweet).  I didn’t know the song, so I share this version by Lucinda Williams with you, as MUFM shared it with my wife and I.  Are you in Memphis or passing through on a Tuesday night?  I urge you to stop on by...but get there early to order food and to get a chair!

I was playing some tab music tonight on ukulele and cam across Ukulenny’s Wipeout (http://www.ukulenny.com).  I realized that I had not made a play along of Wipeout, not had anyone else.

I wanted to make a play along for “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,” and this version was straightforward—but has two other traditional Irish songs.  And thus a medley play along.  I considered shortening the song—but the keys are straightforward and the hardest chord is a diminished chord.

        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Cm.

As performed by Tumble Tots.

Tonight as we were driving back from seeing Incredibles 2, my six year old (fresh out of kindergarten) asked, “Can we sing ‘Elephants Have Wrinkles?’”  So...I did as most fathers would do...I opened Apple Music and we listened to it...five times.  Then my son asked if I would make a play along of this song...so I did.

        <h2><a href="/song/burl-ives-aunt-rhody/">Burl Ives - Aunt Rhody</a></h2>
        <p>June 14, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F and F minor.

As performed by Burl Ives.

Have you ever stopped to wonder why so many of our childhood songs are so dark?  Remember...”Ring Around The Rosy” is supposedly about the Black Plague.

I have been looking for more songs to do, and I want to make sure that we are providing content for beginner players, too.  The directory has a lot of one, two, three, and four chord songs.  But I know there are songs that are missing, so I looked in the table of contents for a ukulele method book, and this song is one of the early songs in that book.

Getting past the depressing lyrics (If Aunt Rhody only cared about the goose for a feather bed, she can still do that, can’t she?), the song is strong from a musical perspective—with two chords in a verse, and switching to minor.  You do need to be able to play f minor—but this song would be an effective way to learn.  It is also a little haunting to hear Burl Ives sing in a minor key—creepy.  Apparently “Resident Evil” used this song as well...so if you use this songs with students, prepare to creep them out.

        <p>June 13, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  Lowered a minor third from the original.

As performed by Randy Newman.

I have wanted to arrange this for some time.  Another video play along showed chords that didn’t match the music (!).  Randy Newman is incredible, and the original chords are tough on ukulele.  I lowered the key to make it work better for ukulele, and there are some chords that I chose that work—but are definitely not the original chord (D#dim and Dm in the intro).  That said, these chords work with the recording—and could be taken away from the recording and performed live.  I might make a chord sheet for this one.

Dedicated to my friend and college roommate, David, who loved Toy Story.  Incidentally, one of my sons is named Andy and had both Woody and Buzz (we didn’t name him after Toy Story...going for the full name “Andrew”)

        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  I have altered the key from the original by a whole step (lower) and minor third (removing a modulation in the song).

As performed by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.

I heard this a couple of days ago at a St. Paul Saints (independent league) baseball game, and thought about making this play along again.  I had tried in the past, but gave up—it is really hard to get the chords to sound right.  This is my best shot..and I think it works.  There is a quick chord change in the verse...but practice it and you’ll get it.  As mentioned previously, I have lowered the key to Am, and taken away the modulation that happens in the bridge.  Enjoy!

I heard this song on the radio the other day, and thought it would be fun as a play along.  It is...but the chords in D didn’t sound right (different inversions than the original).  The chords move fast, and it was tough to get all of the changes in.  Think you can play C, F, and G?  Here’s your real world authentic test (Yes, there is a D or two...but there is no speed needed to play it).

        <p>April 21, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  Lowered a half step from the original key.

As performed by Rick Astley.

This song suddenly appeared on the ukutabs top daily request list, so I decided to put it to a video play along format.  The song is pretty famous for its life after its initial popularity, where people would be taken from a website to this song, as a practical joke (Rick-Rolled).  Online chord charts show the use of a FMaj7...which isn’t a very friendly ukulele chord.  All of the notes of F appear in a FMaj7, so I have just left the chords as plain F, G, Em, and Am chords.  I think it works as it is.

The original song is by Wham, in C.  This version was originally in Bb (transposed up a whole step) as perfomed by the cast of Glee.

I had made a version of the original Wham! recording, but it was blocked in many countries.  This version seems to be used for lyric videos, so hopefully it will be accessible.  It is a very good cover of the original.

As performed by Karsten Troyke & Suzanna as found at https://youtu.be/H6uBysoQkDw

Someone on Ukulele Underground requested the chords for this song, which brought it to my attention.  This is a wonderful folk song in Am.

Translation in English (in Yiddish):

A young lad is thinking, thinking all night
Would it be wrong, he asks, or maybe right,
Should he declare his love, dare he choose,
And would she accept, or will she refuse?

Chorus:
Tumbala, tumbala, tumbalalaika,
Tumbala, tumbala, tumbalalaika
tumbalalaika, play Balalaika,
tumbalalaika - let us be merry.

Maiden, maiden tell me again
What can grow, grow without rain,
What can burn for many years,
What can long and cry without tears?


Silly young lad, why ask again?
It's a stone that can grow, grow without rain,
It's love that can burn for many long years,
A the heart that can yearn and cry without tears.

I really wanted to bring this song to you in the original key, but there was a need to switch from F#m to E...which just isn’t GCEA ukulele friendly.  Therefore, I modified this for the key of G.  Try playing this by alternatively plucking the 3rd string (C string) and the 2nd and 1st strings (E and A strings) at the same time.

I also created a play along of “Let It Go” from the movie Frozen, but there are a few more twists and turns harmonically in that version (https://youtu.be/FyyWuj-jS1U).

There is one part of a verse in this version where a Dm and Cm are substituted for D and C...that’s kind of fun...watch for it.

My boys enjoyed Sing and frequently sing this song.  I had started working on but moved on to other videos.  Katie Denure (One Music School) posted a tutorial today (https://youtu.be/m_Xoe9g00oc), which inspired me to wrap up this video.  I took away some of the fast Ab Bb C changes that occur at the end of some phrases...feel free to add them back in your own practice.  This video offers some good Barre chord practice (partial and full) with Cm, Ab, and Bb.

As performed by Idina Menzel in “Frozen”

The introduction to this song is tricky with some Am sus4, Am, and A chords that are not typical...however, they sounded better where written.  If these are too difficult, I plan to put Demi Lovato’s version of “Let It Go” into a ukulele play along soon, and that uses less complicated chords.  Once you get past the intro, chords are pretty standard, but there are some Bm and Bb chords, and a solitary C chord.

I’m not going to lie...this was a favorite song of mine growing up...and thus my decision to make it a play along.  In G, the hardest chord is Bm (barre chord).  I just read that the makers of Trolls bought the rights to the Puff franchise...so perhaps there will be a new movie about Puff as well as a Justin Timberlake version of this song!

My wife and I finally had the chance to see this a couple of weeks ago (bringing our boys) and we both loved the show.  This duet works very well on the ukulele and in this key, isn’t so hard.  In the areas with C and Csus4, you can also throw in some Cadd9 chords (0203) but the C to Csus4 is easy to do and sounds good.

What an absolutely gorgeous song.  The bridge is stunning, and the ending going from dim7 to tonic is outstanding.  And it works well with the ukulele.  I may try placing this in G, which would be even easier to play on the ukulele—not sure how it will sound in that key (transposed up two whole steps).  The tricky chords are the Bb and the Bbm, and as things go, those aren’t too bad.

As performed by Meghan Trainor.  Most of the chord charts of this song show standard chords...but it doesn’t take long to play with the recording to realize that Meghan Trainor uses some modified (but not overly difficult) chords instead of 1st position chords on the ukulele.  This play along attempts to follow her chords as much as possible. Look for an added note (1st string, 3rd fret) through much of the song.  And in the final progressions, Play Fm to C by leaving C with your 4th finger (pinky).  This should be a nice song to challenge players who are ready to start playing beyond 1st position.  Enjoy!

As performed by Ed Sheeran.

I’ll be honest...this one was tricky. In looking up the chords, a lot of sites have this in D.  That is great...because with a four chord song, I can drop it a whole step and make it beginner friendly with C, Am, F, and G...the “Color Chords (see Kala’s new ukulele).”  Well, I lowered the pitch and things weren’t right...the intro tab had sharps (in C?) and I quickly realized that several sites had ALREADY lowered the pitch for ukulele.  The song was originally in E.  Why E?  It is a great, rich key on the guitar (lots of open strings) and some voices (like Sheeran’s) fit well in the key.  So...I could have gone with D (D, Bm, G, A) or F...but D is a whole step transition, so I went UP the half step to F (F, Dm, Bb, C). I think that’s the right choice, unless you want to play in Sheeran’s original key playing in D (with a Bm barre chord) and using a capo on the 2nd Fret.

        <p>January 01, 2018</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C (original key).

As performed by Ingrid Michaelson.

Check the lyrics as this may not be appropriate for use in a school setting (i.e. “do what the bunnies do,” and “spoon.”).

This version Includes some of the color chords (Fadd9) that Ingrid uses but are not on the chord charts you will find on the internet.  For the Gsus4, play a G chord and add the pinky at the same time.

The original leads to a final chorus that is not accompanied by ukulele.  I ended the play along at that point.  Sorry about the chords there..Ingrid switches to Csus4 to C to Csus4 to C at the end and I didn’t want to add yet another slide.

As performed by Toto.  Transposed up a half step from the original in E.  This key works well..Gm transitions nicely to Eb, Bb to Dm or F is a practical transition as well.

I forgot to include F as one of the eight chords you need to know...please forgive the error...it just isn’t worth exporting and uploading the video to correct it.

        <p>For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.  The original is in A#m (not a great key for ukulele)...so if you want to play the original key, use a capo on the first fret and play these chords.  My boys (age 5 & 9) sing this song all the time (they hear it on the bus on the way to/from school), so I figured it needed to become a play along.  You can experiment with finger picking patterns to match the original guitar.

As performed by Imagine Dragons.

As performed by Simon and Garfunkel.

Dr. Jill Reese, creator of this style of play along, has a full version of Cecilia (https://youtu.be/B1l8YP2ZfrI)  I was uncomfortable with the second verse in an educational setting and removed it.  This is also Simon and Garfunkel’s version, tweaked in pitch to match standard tuning—but the original recording itself wavers in pitch quite a bit.

As performed by REM.

I was looking for a version of this song that better worked when transposed to C (The original Key of the best known version is F), but I couldn’t find one;  this version, however, is in G, and is easier for beginners to play than F (Which uses a barre chord or partial barre chord Bb).

I'll be honest..this was a fun one to work on.  It is shifted up a whole step from the original recording.   None of the online lead sheets matched what I was hearing..and I tried to incorporate some of the passing tones with chords like Cmaj7.  In this key, the song is pretty straightforward and fun to play.  Listen to the song for strumming pattern ideas (e.g. single strums at the beginning).

        <p>July 02, 2017</p>
        <p>For Educational Use.  Optimized for GCEA Ukulele.  Key of C.

In my opinion, two things led to the decline of the ukulele in the late 1960s (continuing until the early 2000s).  The first was the emergence of guitar-based rock (and people wanting to be rock stars), and the image of Tiny Tim.  As part of his "gimmick," Tiny Tim played the ukulele and sang in a weird falsetto, causing an entire generation to associate the ukulele with being a weirdo and maybe even a freak.  When you look deeper at Tiny Tim, he was an accomplished musician but he also knew how to make his mark using a gimmick.

See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMbQsKJ64S0

A number of factors led to the re-emergence of the ukulele in the early 2000s, but even today some people have the mental image of Tiny Tim when they think of the ukulele.  I even had a teacher come up to me at a convention and start singing, "Tiptoe Through the Tulips."

You know what?  We cannot escape the history of this instrument, and Tiny Tim had an impact on it.  That should be acknowledged.  It should also be noted that his signature song, "Tiptoe Through the Tulips," existed long before he used it--written in 1929.

Now, about this rendition...I have modified Tiny Tim's recording down a major 3rd so it matches common chord progressions.  He plays it in E, but may be using a ukulele that is tuned A D F# B, which would essentially make the song like playing in D on a GCEA ukulele.

Usually, changing the pitch of a song more than a second makes the audio unrecognizable--in this case, as Tiny Tim uses his falsetto, it isn't as noticeable.  If you want to play along with Tiny Tim's recording at pitch, use a Capo at the 4th fret and use these chords, or tune your ukulele to ADF#B and play it in D (C becomes D, etc.).

One note...during the longer instrumental break, I have the chords switching from F to G.  You could make the case that it should be Dm to G, which is a difference of one note on the ukulele.  However, the whole break is an extension of the previously sung lyrics over F and G...and in the interest of keeping 4 chords (no G7!), I went with F to G.</p>

The original song is in Ab and A...and it becomes much easier to play in F.  However, the original audio becomes strange if the pitch is modified that much.  Therefore, I dropped the audio a half step to G...resulting in this play along.

The last section modulates a half step...this is pretty easy to do with the barre chords provided.  That said...you need to be ready for them.

This is not a ukulele play along for beginners...but it is a great song, and advanced players should have some play along videos that challenge them, too!

There are some very quick chord changes and chord ambiguity in those same less familiar verses.  These didn't work out as well as I would have hoped for...but the main instructional point is repetition of C, Am, F, G7, following the instructional materials used by the Tampa Bay Ukulele Society.

        <p>June 06, 2017</p>
        <p>For educational use.  Folsom Prison Blues by Johnny Cash.  Key of F (F, F7, Bb, C7).

Whenever I attend a ukulele jam, this song is requested.  This is the original key (lowered slightly in pitch to match A=440)...I will be making a version in a higher key to match the chords in Jim Beloff's The Daily Ukulele.  I am attempting to make play alongs for songs that are fun to play, and for those that are commonly requested at ukulele jams, so that young/new players can feel at home in those jam sessions, being familiar with the "genre" of "popular" ukulele songs.

All rights remain with the music company who holds Johnny Cash's work; any advertisements that appear are for that company--not for this channel.

        <p>June 05, 2017</p>
        <p>For educational purposes.  The Brothers Four version of Beautiful Brown Eyes transposed to the Key of D (D, G, E7, A7).  You can leave the E7 out, but the Brothers Four definitely sing an E7 in harmony on each chorus.

The intent of this ukulele play along is to provide songs that are frequently performed at ukulele jam sessions from all age groups.

The original YouTube video of this song (in its original key) can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SthMCp539j0

        <p>June 05, 2017</p>
        <p>For educational purposes--all rights remain with the group.

"Crazy" by Burn the Ballroom.  In the Key of F (F, A, Dm, Bb, Bbm, C, C7).  I heard this song as bumper music on the Tony Kornheiser Show--and it stick in my head as a great song for a ukulele play along.  The lyrics may not be appropriate for young students.  The melody is wonderful!

This song was fun to work out, as the chords were not readily available on various "tab" websites.

The group's albums and this song can be found on iTunes and Amazon.   You can also access the group's YouTube recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrSlr2LxdDk

        <p>A Ukulele Play Along version of This Land Is Your Land in the Key of C (F, C, G7).  Song by Woody Guthrie, performance by Elizabeth Mitchell.   For educational purposes.  Audio edited to just include a few verses from this lyric video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRnHx3yVuf4.

Many of the ukulele play alongs are created with pop music to keep students engaged.  I am 100% behind that effort--however, I am trying to bring songs that are often used at ukulele jam sessions to this format as well, so that all players can become material with some of the more common "ukulele songs" and sing and play together.

        <p>June 02, 2017</p>
        <p>A ukulele play along of "Waltzing Matilda" in the key of C: C, G7, Am, F.

I chose to make this song into a play along as it is commonly requested at a local jam session.  While I want to continue to prepare pop tunes for students, I also want them to learn some of the folk tradition and common literature played in ukulele groups.

For this song, I used the audio track by Slim Dusty from this lyric YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2DSil5RriU

I had to lower the audio by a whole step to get into the Key of C (I also had to raise the pitch a bit to get it in tune with A440).

I didn't want to use the original video as the text was impossible to read and the words didn't match the singer's words.

As there are a number of Australian terms in the song, I also included the information about the song from Rolf Harris on this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEVKUE_ma00

The part just before the chorus has slightly different chords... watch the video carefully!
Can be played with D-U-U-U-U strumming or following the finger picking guide. This is a decent song for beginners to practice figuring out tab and finger picking, but speed is the main issue.

I transposed the song down to the key of D to make it more friendly for the ukulele.

This video features:
--demonstration of the "hammer-on" technique
--a hammer-on pattern to play throughout the song
--a strumming pattern for chords that can be played throughout the song
--you may choose to switch back and forth between playing the hammer-on pattern and chords. (The play-along screen is split so you see both the hammer pattern and the chords.)

A fun song for summer!
