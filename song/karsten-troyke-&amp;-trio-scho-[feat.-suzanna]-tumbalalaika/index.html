<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Am.

As performed by Karsten Troyke & Suzanna as found at https://youtu.be/H6uBysoQkDw

Someone on Ukulele Underground requested the chords for this song, which brought it to my attention.  This is a wonderful folk song in Am.

Translation in English (in Yiddish):

A young lad is thinking, thinking all night
Would it be wrong, he asks, or maybe right,
Should he declare his love, dare he choose,
And would she accept, or will she refuse?

Chorus:
Tumbala, tumbala, tumbalalaika,
Tumbala, tumbala, tumbalalaika
tumbalalaika, play Balalaika,
tumbalalaika - let us be merry.

Maiden, maiden tell me again
What can grow, grow without rain,
What can burn for many years,
What can long and cry without tears?


Silly young lad, why ask again?
It's a stone that can grow, grow without rain,
It's love that can burn for many long years,
A the heart that can yearn and cry without tears.
