<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  As performed by The Village People.

The original version of this song is in F#, and the audio has been raised a half step to make it easier to play.

There is an existing ukulele play along of this song, without words and in the Key of C, created by Dr. Jill Reese.  You can find this version here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MODmsfPS3xA

I simply wanted a version with the voices.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com"><meta name="author" content="Author Name">
