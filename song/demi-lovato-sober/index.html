    <title itemprop="name">Demi Lovato - Sober</title>
<meta name="description" content="This tutorial will show you how to play Sober on the ukulele by Demi Lovato. The chords used are C F G Am.

*Note - this video contains mature subject matter, no foul language. It's not a video I usually do but with so many people struggling with addictions, mental health issues and just struggling with life, I found the raw emotions and openness compelling.
