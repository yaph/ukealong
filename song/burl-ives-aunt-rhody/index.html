    <title itemprop="name">Burl Ives - Aunt Rhody</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F and F minor.

As performed by Burl Ives.

Have you ever stopped to wonder why so many of our childhood songs are so dark?  Remember...”Ring Around The Rosy” is supposedly about the Black Plague.

I have been looking for more songs to do, and I want to make sure that we are providing content for beginner players, too.  The directory has a lot of one, two, three, and four chord songs.  But I know there are songs that are missing, so I looked in the table of contents for a ukulele method book, and this song is one of the early songs in that book.

Getting past the depressing lyrics (If Aunt Rhody only cared about the goose for a feather bed, she can still do that, can’t she?), the song is strong from a musical perspective—with two chords in a verse, and switching to minor.  You do need to be able to play f minor—but this song would be an effective way to learn.  It is also a little haunting to hear Burl Ives sing in a minor key—creepy.  Apparently “Resident Evil” used this song as well...so if you use this songs with students, prepare to creep them out.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
