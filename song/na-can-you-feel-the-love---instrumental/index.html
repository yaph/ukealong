    <title itemprop="name">Na - Can You Feel The Love - Instrumental</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  The original (by Elton John—not the version in the movie) is in Bb, so this version is raised a whole step.  This is a great song to introduce Bb (if you know the other chords), as the chord changes are nice and slow and a single strum per beat works very well with the song.

As performed by Elton John.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
