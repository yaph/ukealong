        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  The Going to the Beach Song! by Scratch Garden.  The original video may be found here: https://youtu.be/vEZkJhoUI5w.  All I did was add a drum part so music students could play along.

I recommend having a soft drum cover the RED DRUM, and then have everybody hit on the BROWN DRUM.  You could use djembe, conga, bongo, tambourine, shaker, BUCKET DRUM, etc.  Just so the kids learn to keep a steady beat and enjoy drumming!

        <description><![CDATA[In this video I compare a concert uke to a baritone uke.  All of the chord shapes (chord forms) are the same, they just have different names.

No Time To Die - Billie Eilish
From the James Bond Film

Using the chords: A  Am  B7  Cmaj7  Em

Suggested Strum Pattern:  D D D DU or single strums
You can be quite flexible with the strumming as it is slow

If you prefer, try playing some of the Am and Cmaj7 chords with your 1st finger to make it easier to move to the Em and B7 chords
