    <title itemprop="name">Demi Lovato - Let It Go (From "Frozen / Single Version)</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G (Original Key)

As performed by Demi Lovato.

I also created a play along of “Let It Go” from the movie Frozen, but there are a few more twists and turns harmonically in that version (https://youtu.be/FyyWuj-jS1U).

There is one part of a verse in this version where a Dm and Cm are substituted for D and C...that’s kind of fun...watch for it.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
