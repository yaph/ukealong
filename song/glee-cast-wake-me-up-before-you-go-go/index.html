    <title itemprop="name">Glee Cast - Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go (Glee Cast Version)</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

The original song is by Wham, in C.  This version was originally in Bb (transposed up a whole step) as perfomed by the cast of Glee.

I had made a version of the original Wham! recording, but it was blocked in many countries.  This version seems to be used for lyric videos, so hopefully it will be accessible.  It is a very good cover of the original.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

Check out the Ukulele Video Play Along Podcast, where I talk about ukulele education and my own ukulele experiences.  Available on Apple Podcasts and Google Play.
