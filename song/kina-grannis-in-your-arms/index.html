    <title itemprop="name">Kina Grannis - In Your Arms</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.  C, Am, F, G...in the original key!

As performed by Kina Grannis.

I played the stop motion video of this for my students but then decided to make a play along video for it as well (it was in C and used four basic chords).  https://youtu.be/IOu0DuxFAT0

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com."><meta name="author" content="Author Name">
