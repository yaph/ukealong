    <title itemprop="name">Muffin Songs - Hush Little Baby</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA Ukulele.  Keys of F & G.

As performed by Muffin Songs in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs9cCeTsT8Q

I was preparing simpler versions of this song and heard this version and wanted to add the chords to it.  This song, with a key change and some easier added chords really makes this song fun to play.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com."><meta name="author" content="Author Name">
