    <title itemprop="name">Larry Groce, Disneyland Children's Sing-Along Chorus - Shoo, Fly, Don't Bother Me (Vocal)</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  As performed by Larry Groce and the Disneyland Children's Sing-Along Chorus.  Original video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tlk6fjZ0nf4

The original version of this song is in G, and the audio has been lowered a whole step to be in the Key of F (this Key was a special request).  Look for the version in G as well, as that is also a good key for ukulele..

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com"><meta name="author" content="Author Name">
