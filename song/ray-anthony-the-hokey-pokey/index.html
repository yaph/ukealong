    <title itemprop="name">Ray Anthony - The Hokey Pokey</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.

Two chords: G & D7 (Hawaiian, but you can substitute the full D7)

As performed by Ray Anthony and His Orchestra.

Need to practice at a different tempo?  Use the gear icon in the video (lower right) to slow down (or speed up) the tempo at pitch!  Need to do so on an iPad or iPhone?  Check out the browser called "iCab Mobile" which has a Module called "Video Playback Rate"

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

The colored font matches Aquila KIDS ukulele strings.

This version matches the educational Color Chord approach and uses four chords: C (red sticker), G (green stickers), F (yellow stickers) and Am (blue sticker).
