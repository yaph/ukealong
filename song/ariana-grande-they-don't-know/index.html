    <title itemprop="name">Ariana Grande - They Don't Know</title>
<meta name="description" content="This tutorial will show you how to play They Don’t Know on the ukulele by Ariana Grande. The chords used are G C D Em Bm.

*Note - In the progression G G C D if you are playing w a band second G should be G/B, where the bass plays the B or keys plays G on right hand and B on the left hand.
Also, There is a B/D# before each chorus but I left it out to make it easier for beginners.
