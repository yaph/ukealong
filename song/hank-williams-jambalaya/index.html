    <title itemprop="name">Hank Williams - Jambalaya</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of C.

Chords Used: C, G7

As performed by Hank Williams.

Dr. Reese has had a video of this available for a long time, but the original recording was in a different tuning.  This version has been adjusted to A440.

This video was also blocked on YouTube since it was published (Feb 2, 2019), but the copyright holders recently removed the restrictions on the video.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

There is a master list of all similar play along videos at my blog: ukestuff.info.  Access to the blog, and all materials on the blog is free.
