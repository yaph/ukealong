<meta name="description" content="For educational purposes.  The Brothers Four version of Beautiful Brown Eyes transposed to the Key of D (D, G, E7, A7).  You can leave the E7 out, but the Brothers Four definitely sing an E7 in harmony on each chorus.

The intent of this ukulele play along is to provide songs that are frequently performed at ukulele jam sessions from all age groups.

The original YouTube video of this song (in its original key) can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SthMCp539j0

The ukulele chord font is from Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com."><meta name="author" content="Author Name">
