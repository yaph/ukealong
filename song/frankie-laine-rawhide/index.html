    <title itemprop="name">Frankie Laine - Rawhide</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of Em.

As performed by Frankie Laine.

I’m likely going to recreate Jolene with color chord symbols and Color Chord this weekend...and as I hear that song, I think of this song...and the Blues Brothers use of this song.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
