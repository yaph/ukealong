<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of F.  Original Key.

As performed by Cody Simpson.  Used in "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2."

I want to thank my student, Ben C., for suggesting this song as a play along.

Beats 2 & 4 are strong in the chorus of this song; you can use the suggested strumming pattern or make your own.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.

There is a master list of all similar play along videos at my blog: ukestuff.info.  Access to the blog, and all materials on the blog is free.
