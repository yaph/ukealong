<meta name="description" content="For Educational Use.  26 Miles (Santa Catalina) by the Four Preps.  In the Key of C: C, Am, F, G7, Dm, C7, Hawaiian D7, G.

I have been making ukulele video play alongs, and this song is a common request at ukulele jam sessions.  Featured prominently in the song is the standard four chord progression.

As a note, the original recording (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dPaeUGrmdA) seems to be in C#...I don't know why they would have sung it in that key--even with Guitars--so I have dropped the pitch one half step to be in the Key of C.
