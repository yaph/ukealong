    <title itemprop="name">Mona Mor - Let It Go</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Key of G.  Lowered one half step from the original key.

As performed by Idina Menzel in “Frozen”

The introduction to this song is tricky with some Am sus4, Am, and A chords that are not typical...however, they sounded better where written.  If these are too difficult, I plan to put Demi Lovato’s version of “Let It Go” into a ukulele play along soon, and that uses less complicated chords.  Once you get past the intro, chords are pretty standard, but there are some Bm and Bb chords, and a solitary C chord.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
