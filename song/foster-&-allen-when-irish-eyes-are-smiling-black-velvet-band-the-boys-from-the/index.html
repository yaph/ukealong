    <title itemprop="name">Foster & Allen - When Irish Eyes Are Smiling/Black Velvet Band/The Boys From The</title>
<meta name="description" content="For educational use.  Optimized for GCEA ukulele.  Keys of C, F, and G

The songs in the medley:

When Irish Eyes Are Smiling (In C)
The Black Velvet Band (Modulates to F)
The Boys from County Amargh (Modulates to G)

As performed by Foster & Allen

I wanted to make a play along for “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,” and this version was straightforward—but has two other traditional Irish songs.  And thus a medley play along.  I considered shortening the song—but the keys are straightforward and the hardest chord is a diminished chord.

Video created on the iPad Pro using Luma Fusion.  The ukulele chord font is Chordette for Education, available at ukefarm.com.
