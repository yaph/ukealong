        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  The Going to the Beach Song! by Scratch Garden.  The original video may be found here: https://youtu.be/vEZkJhoUI5w.  All I did was add a drum part so music students could play along.

I recommend having a soft drum cover the RED DRUM, and then have everybody hit on the BROWN DRUM.  You could use djembe, conga, bongo, tambourine, shaker, BUCKET DRUM, etc.  Just so the kids learn to keep a steady beat and enjoy drumming!

        <description><![CDATA[For educational use.  Do It Like the Zombies Do, from Disneyâ€™s Zombieâ€™s 2.  The play along is for any high, low drum, shaker, and clapping.  It could be a djembe with bass & slap, or tubanos, or bongos, or any combination of high & low drums.  I will use it with African drum circle instruments in my classroom.
